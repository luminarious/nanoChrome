    "text": "nanoChrome is a role-playing and adventure game set in a cyberpunk universe - a mixture of very contemporary situations and science-fiction exoticism. This is the second edition of this game, quite seriously expanded and also benefiting from many feedbacks from testers and players. Thanks to them for their attention to the small details.\nEach player will need a character sheet, a pencil, an eraser and three six-sided dice (marked d6 in this book), one of which must be different from the others, either by size or colour. Finally, a few post-its or note sheets are not to be ignored. As for the rest, drinks and various snacks can enhance the time spent around the table - but abusing them may limit your life expectancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the complete character sheets and many other game aids at legrumph.org\n\n\n\nYes, but what is a “role-playing adventure game”? A role-playing game, or RPG, is a board game whose main purpose is to tell stories together. There are many forms of RPGs, but nanoChrome is also an adventure game. Here, one of the participants is the game leader: his role is to bring the world where the adventures take place to life and to referee the game. The other players play as characters, inhabitants of the world and heroes of the adventures. There are no winners or losers - the leader is not the players’ opponent and vice versa. The game ends when all the players feel that the adventure is over and the story has come to an end - this may take several play sessions and it is up to each playgroup to decide how long they want to play.\nThe easiest way to explain a role-playing game is to imagine a small programme:\n\nThe players choose an alter ego in the game. This is their character.\nThe player tells the leader what their character is doing or asks a question.\nThe leader tells the players what is happening or answers the question. what is happening or answers the question.\nStart again in 2.\n\nThe game then takes the form of a long dialogue in which the players and the leader construct a story. When the leader and players are unsure of how the story can move forward (how to get back to 1), they can refer to a set of rules and hints which form, in fact, part of the rest of this book.",

    "text": "Mood and style\nWhen the cyberpunk movement took off in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it was science fiction. Imagine what it offered: a global telematics network, super-powerful computers, neural connections, cybernetic limbs, nation-states replaced by super-powerful transnational corporations like a synarchic dream finally realized, pollution on a massive scale, health scandals, corruption of all politicians, a globalized culture, the cult of the money-king, mass media at the peak of their power…\nToday, they are everyday realities or promises close to fulfillment - the omnipotence of banks, artificial transplants, the Internet, peak oil and the Chinese on the Moon.\nTo survive, cyberpunk has been forced to become transhumanist, to project itself a little further into the future and into the stars.\nBut classic cyberpunk still holds many treasures that can be explored. First of all, it’s a reflection of our world, but one that we can stand back from - we really are “twenty minutes in the future”. It’s always difficult to tell political fiction stories in universes too close to us; you only have to open newspapers to get your fill of political and economic prevarications and betrayals of humanity and to be on the verge of nausea or despair - no need to add to that in a game that is supposed to help us escape from this absurd and frustrating daily life.\nNevertheless, with a little adventurous distance, with some exotic elements, with some minor changes here and there, it is possible to reinvest these areas of narrative and offer a social and political critique, as all science fiction writers in general and cyberpunk in particular do, in a fun and exciting—and hopefully much less despairing—form.\nCyberpunk is a delicate blend of hard-boiled thriller, paramilitary action, social-political anticipation and technological exoticism.",

    "text": "Hard-boiled thriller\n\ncyberpunk heroes are tough. They carry out difficult investigations. They anger the powerful. They abuse drugs and stimulants. They have corpses in the wardrobe. But they also have friends and luck, if not pure anger, that keeps them going no matter how many obstacles are put in their way.\n\nParamilitary action\n\na tradition inherited from video games and early role-playing games, as much as from the classic literature of the genre, action is at the heart of most cyberpunk stories. Doughnuts and bullets fly around at every opportunity, usually spontaneously. But the characters are just as often called upon to participate in paramilitary operations: intrusions, kidnappings, protection of people and places, theft and hacking, exploration of forbidden zones, urban combat, surveillance, espionage, etc.\n\nPolitico-social anticipation\n\nif the original cyberpunk was dark anticipation, it has become at most short-term foresight and a direct projection of our daily anxieties. We have ample examples of this: objective or obscurantist dictatorships, ethnic massacres, calls for war by hawks of all stripes, systematic recourse to torture, wars of economic interests, organization of the ruin and plundering of regions of the globe under bank control, creation of novlanguages in the service of the mass media, ethical and moral blackmail, trivialization of all security, exceptional measures which are becoming the norm, privatization of the judiciary and the criminal justice system, sanitary and pharmaceutical scandals, global epidemics, revolutions and civil wars, repression of alternative trade union and political movements, democratic masquerades by lobbies and technocrats, an explosion of misery and mass unemployment, destruction of food resources, sources of drinking water and vast ecosystems, the uncontrolled dissemination of genetically modified crops, massive exploitation of the proletariat in poor countries, privatization of education, religious fundamentalists infiltrating all centres of political and cultural decision making, etc. - Not to mention a major climate catastrophe looming over us. It’s enough to inspire any dark dystopia. Yet it is here and now that it is happening. It’s easy enough to add a little something to push this or that concept a step further, by extrapolating or caricaturing existing situations.\n\nTechnological exoticism\n\nif you stick to the first three points below, you don’t get much more than a contemporary game, a sort of Tom Clancy universe. Interesting, but without the exoticism that adds a bit of humour and distance to the game. So don’t forget that cyberpunk is also about advanced technology and futuristic design - who doesn’t admire the sleek bodywork of police battle mechs? The internet exists, but it’s a universal augmented reality matrix, not just a minitel. Guns are wired directly to the nerves and use caseless ammunition. If you lose an arm or an eye, it is replaced in a jiffy by a ceramic and metal equivalent. If you have defective genes, they are repaired with a few injected stem cells. Asteroids have been placed on the Lagrange points and are accessed by orbital lift. Technology plays the same role in cyberpunk as magic does in fantasy - an enabler, a shortcut, a hook. It distracts players from the darker themes of the game, while allowing them to approach them in a playful way.",

    "text": "Three must-haves\n\nThe old world is dying, the new world is slow in appearing, and in this chiaroscuro monsters are emerging.\n—Antonio Gramsci\n\nBefore you start playing the game and creating the characters, outline these three essential elements of the world to your players. Many of the rules of the game derive directly from these fundamental concepts.\n\nAkashic Matrix and neurotronics\nIn the past, the world’s various interconnected telematics networks operated on a complete physical basis: exchanges, physical memories, routers, wireless transmitters, terminals, etc. This changed with the advent of the Akashic Matrix and neurotronics. Everything changed with the appearance of the first quantum computers. Within months of the first processors going live, engineers saw an incomprehensible increase in the processing and storage capabilities of the machines - a phenomenon that became even more dramatic as the technology was brought to market and used in everyday life.\nIn fact, quantum computers are leaking. Their data is interconnecting in what has come to be known as the Akashic Field, the Akasha, to form a single, giant supercomputer where everyone is connected and where all unprotected data inevitably ends up. Anyone can access or manipulate this Akashic matrix if they have a simple quantum device - a nexus.\nWhat could have been an industrial disaster on a human scale - all the computers dumping their data in one place accessible to all - turned out to be a godsend. Competing neurotronic technology, based on bio-neurons, was completely immune to the problem. The neurotronic memories did not leak and protected their data and programs perfectly well behind traditional firewalls and existing security.\nWe soon found ourselves with two different, interconnected but perfectly distinct systems: the personal and professional neurotronic machines, capable of protecting data; and the quantum machines directly connected to a universal matrix that soon replaced all other communication channels for media broadcasting, social networking, the development of virtual reality, but also computing power and all those sorts of things.\nIn practical terms, it is considered that everyone is permanently connected to the Akashic Matrix through Nexuses, small personal quantum blocks with processors and neurotronic memories protecting certain personal data. This connection is achieved within augmented reality - the superimposition of virtual data and information on the natural perception of the world. The brain learns at an early age to mix these two realities into one, where what is real and what is projected are inseparable. Thus, for example, one usually wears only tight-fitting suits of neutral grey, in morphotextiles, while one can project, in augmented reality, all sorts of clothes according to the occasions of the day - strict suits for work, pretty fashionable dresses for the after-hours and casual wear at home, not to mention all the fantasies that are physically impossible but that the matrix allows without worrying about ever having to change.\nThe problems start when clever people try to manipulate each other’s perceptions by altering augmented reality to disguise elements of normal reality or try to access data from connected neurotronic memories. Fortunately, most nexuses are protected by powerful firewalls which considerably limit the risks, especially since the security of the city is usually sufficient.\nAnd then there are the Akashic minds.\nConcurrently with the rise of the quantum matrix, two phenomena appeared: on the one hand, some expert system cores escaped into the quantum field and found there the computational and expansion resources necessary for their awakening to a kind of limited, animal consciousness; on the other hand, the first experimental quantum memory cells also escaped, leading to the loss of complete human consciousnesses in the quantum field space.\nThese phenomena became the spirits of the matrix - both demiurges and demons, masters and servants, lost in the vastness of the matrix and constantly seeking to stabilise their limits of singularity in order to continue to exist without diluting themselves.\n\n\nStructure of the city\nIn the common vocabulary, the world is divided on the one hand into geographical zones - countries, cities, neighbourhoods, etc. - and on the other hand into zones of identity. - In the common vocabulary, the world is divided into geographical zones - countries, cities, neighbourhoods, etc. - and into security zones - a good indication of the degree of protection or tranquillity one can expect from the authorities.\n\nThe anarzone refers to all territories with zero security. These are on the one hand the still wild regions of the globe, but also all urban and peri-urban areas abandoned by corporations and local authorities. The anarzone is a lawless zone, where all those who want to escape the permanent surveillance of the corporations take refuge. You don’t go to the anarzone without good reasons, strong back-up, a good dose of guts or if you are not a native - of course, the player characters often live in the anarzone.\nThe conurbation refers to urban areas protected by the government. Security exists but is relatively minimal. The conurb essentially covers residential or semi-industrial areas, public parks and gardens, and most of the road network. Do not expect miracles, but the police and civil security forces always intervene eventually.\nEnclaves are all areas protected by corporations and their security services. They range from commercial areas to office floors, from corporatist contract areas to factories and industrial zones. Security is more or less high, but always provided by important investments - don’t worry, in the end, it’s always you who pays.\nAnti-zones are all areas of very high security - corporate laboratories, research and development areas, protected military zones, homes of very high ranking officials, etc. Security is at its highest, both physically and in the matrix - these are places where coders risk death if they encounter black ice. You don’t venture into an antizone without serious credentials or titanium balls.\n\n\n\nOrbitals\n\nThe last point considered unavoidable is the presence of humans in near space - don’t worry, no one has conquered Mars yet (unless you really want to, Total Recall style). More than the previous two points, you can of course ignore this one, but it still provides much of the technological exoticism needed for the game and it provides some good villains for your adventures. And then it’s a fitting tribute to one of the best cyberpunk novels ever written.\n—Walter Jon Williams’ Wired.\n\nThe colonisation of Earth’s orbit began long ago with the installation of two large rocks recovered from the asteroid belt at the Moon’s Lagrange points. The first, at L4, is called Ulysses, the second at L5 is called Caystros. They were hollowed out during their long journey by huge mining operations, and are now home to microgravity factories and corporate facilities of the highest standing. These two asteroids are surrounded by dozens of space stations of various sizes, mostly housing factories and dormitories for the workers who work there. Collectively, all the inhabited bodies orbiting the Earth are called the Moon Islands (a name already used on Earth for the Comoros Islands).\nTo access the Moon Islands, an orbital lift has been built somewhere on the equator. Depending on your preferences and the geopolitical choices of your campaign, place it in Brazil, Indonesia, Kenya… From the orbital lift station, the orbitals go back and forth between all the facilities in small hydrogen-powered ships called Kwasa Coasters.\nMost of the orbitals have been augmented to adapt to microgravity conditions and no longer return to earth. They consider themselves above the mire, like advanced humanity. The ten largest transnational corporations are orbital and meddle in controlling the destiny of billions of surface people by triggering conflicts and crises at their convenience.\nUlysses is the base for most of the ten largest orbital corporations, as well as the orbital council that brings them together. Caystos is an international political centre, housing the new UN council and the Hague tribunal, which was moved there after the former was destroyed in an unclaimed attack.",

    "text": "What we play\nYou have at least three ways to play nanoChrome. Ask your players what they want to do, what ties their characters together, and what takes them on an adventure together.\nTechmercs: the characters are penniless techmercs who take on any black operations that shady individuals, collectively and slangly called The Client, offer them, usually on behalf of corporations or organisations that value their discretion. This game mode is perfect for games on the go: a meeting, a contract, a bit of investigation, an intrusion, a betrayal, a few bullets exchanged and there you go.\nCorporates: in this game mode, which is suitable for both campaign and quick games, the characters are corporatist agents. They have a clearly identified employer, material resources and some legal protection (at least to a certain extent). Of course, not only does their boss expect results, but they will also have to deal with the inertia of their company’s politics, the gossip at the coffee machine, the jealousy of pushy colleagues and the countless pitfalls of corporate life. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent the company in question from being a government agency or a police department.\nPanopticom: in this game mode, your characters are outcasts and characters are splendid outsiders and losers. In appearance at least. In reality, they are rebellious underground journalists who provide full reports and investigations to a pirate show from the Matrix: Panopticom. Think of it as a nice Wikileaks/The Pirate Bay/Mediapart mix… Crisp and scandalous, but not people! This approach is perfect for campaign adventures, if you like investigation, secrets and open-ended sandbox play.\nOf course, you can mix and match: Panopticom journalists infiltrating a corpo and moonlighting as techmercs to collect cash to fund their operations; or corpos infiltrating the techmerc world to get their hands on one of their company’s big enemies. Or any other exotic mix you like…\n\nA moral issue\nThis is the time to ask your players where they want to place the moral slider for their characters. Is it acceptable or appropriate to kill in cold blood, to murder a prisoner, to torture for information, to sacrifice innocents to achieve one’s goals? Or are the characters not paragons of virtue, heroes who are in no way capable of committing atrocities?\nIt is very important that this question be discussed immediately before a character commits an irreparable act before the indignant eyes of his comrades. In the past, characters had an alignment that defined, more or less, the moral boundary of a gaming group. Here, prevention is better than cure!\nFrom the point of view of the game leader, this decision can greatly influence the way he plays the world. Faced with ruthless characters, you have to play hard, very hard. Don’t hesitate to kill, mutilate, and hurt extras and characters who have the misfortune to fall. Faced with heroic characters, the villains will not be so morally bound (they can always murder, pillage, torture to achieve their goals), but the heroes always have a chance to get out of it and will, at the very least, be respected by their enemies and helped by the population.",

Usually it will be in the corner of a large city and you won’t move much. It could be Hong Kong, one of the big North American conurbations (SanSan, BosWash or ChiPi), Tokyo, Lagos, Mexico City, the east coast of Australia or even Paris… But it’s quite possible your players will surprise you.\nIf you don’t have a lot of time, it is best to choose a region that you know a little about from reading or watching films. The important thing is that you have images and moods in mind.\nIf you have a little more time, look at a map of the area, open its Wikipedia entry, walk around it via Streetview and make some notes on place names or neighbourhoods. You don’t need to do much more than that - the important thing is to find a series of details that will feel ‘real’ and set the mood.\nThen go round the table with your players and take notes:\n\nAsk them what they know about the town and the region, and ask them to describe some of the places that stand out, some of the atmosphere they want to find there. Try to ‘futurise’ the places to make a perfect Chrome City…\nAsk them to tell you about people, cultures, society, politics, trends, fashion. Chrome City is not only buildings and streets, interchanges and wastelands, museums and archologies, but also and above all its inhabitants, as diverse as they are cosmopolitan, colourful, strange, offbeat - here too, project yourself into a possible future.\nFinally, ask each of them to give you an event that is in the news, whether it is a headline in the newspapers or a rumour in the most confidential circles…\n\nUse the following lists to add to or find names and concepts that you like…",

Each paying spectator has a certain number of votes during the game - spectators who watch the game in the stands have more votes than those registered for the akhashic broadcasts. At any time it is possible to vote for a player or a team.

    "text": "Affiliations\nAn affiliation indicates your culture of reference, the value system in which you were raised. Each affiliation has a small special ability that you can activate by spending a connection point (see page 100) [].\n\nCorpo\nYou belong to the upper social strata of society. You have a good education, you have money saved up. You can use connection points to show off your privileges: blowing up a charge or a fine, passing a checkpoint, getting a table without a reservation or getting into the VIP area of a fashionable club (see page 218) See intrusions.\n\n\nGanger\nYou grew up on the streets, left to your own devices, and found family and colour in a gang. You have a special relationship with your gang members, even if you are no longer part of them, and can spend connection points to, for example, receive help, find shelter or collect equipment (see page 156).\n\n\nIndependent\nYou blend into the interstices of the world, where no one seems to notice you. You are anonymous, a part of the scenery. Nothing flashy, nothing remarkable. You can use your connection points to cover your tracks, to blend in - practically, you get nothing, but you prevent others from getting things about you.\n\n\n/C\nYou belong to one of the many counter-cultures that flourish here and there - altnerds, nomads, borgs, purists, immobile, neoniks, etc. Describe your /C to the leader and the other players; find details that put you a bit on the fringes of society and make you a bit weird. Each connection point you spend on an action gives you a +2 bonus to the roll.\n\nIn an age where social validation no longer necessarily depends on the opinions of your relatives, neighbours and the people in the village you’ll never leave in your life, counter-cultures are flourishing around the world. All it takes is a few crazy people who meet at random in virtual lounges, somewhere in the vast cultural troll that floats in the matrix. From then on, dominant legitimacy becomes superfluous; one can live one’s own way, with one’s desires, ideas, whims, and traits of genius; one can create new habitus, new taboos, new norms that become dominant in a small but sufficient circle. This is what the /Cs are. Imagine what you want: cybersadhus crunching pills upon pills to achieve enlightenment? Fierce anti-government activists, paranoid no doubt but possessing some evidence that gives them some security? Fundamentalist peasants who abhor technology and the matrix? A cult worshipping an Akhashic guru who only appears in the virtual world? Tuning enthusiasts who are gradually transforming themselves into real experimental cyborgs?",

    "text": "Occupations\nEach occupation indicates the specialisation you have chosen and the specific abilities you have learned (note your two abilities!). It is impossible to learn these abilities with experience.\n\nRigger\nYou are a special kind of coder, specialising in the use and piloting of vehicles and drones. You immerse yourself so deeply in the machines that you become one with them, their carcass becoming your body. Note that if you choose this occupation, you receive the Neuronic cybernetic augmentation for free (see page 72). For rules on drones and vehicles, see page 167.\n\nStarred abilities can be selected multiple times with experience.\n\nDRONES *: You always have three specialised drones at your disposal, which you can ride on quickly. If they are destroyed, you get them back at the end of the cycle. If you take over this ability, you have an additional drone.\nTRANSFER: When you connect to a vehicle, you become fully immersed in that vehicle with all of its abilities and possibilities, even if you are not directly on board.\n\n\nHacker\nYou are a matrix technician, able to manipulate data streams from your nexus - in a way that the system administrators don’t like at all because of the illegal programs you constantly load onto the matrix. You can find the rules on the matrix on page 135.\nCONNECTION: You are constantly connected to the matrix. You have 3 additional connection points.\nNERVES OF STEEL: By spending one point of luck, you can automatically succeed in a non-combat action as if you had rolled a triple-6.\n\n\nFace\nYou are a charismatic individual with many contacts. Your main occupation is to pass information between the right people and to grow your own portfolio of knowledge and secrets. You will find the rules on relationships on pages 80 and 155.\nIMPROVISATION: You can use your connection points as plan points (see page 216), even if you haven’t really had time to prepare anything.\nRELATIONSHIPS: You can create a temporary contact on the fly by giving them a name and an area of activity and service, then call on them by spending connection points.\n\n\nFighter\nBodyguard, mercenary, assassin, soldier, you are physically and mentally trained for war - conventional warfare, street fighting, guerrilla warfare and terrorism. You are likely to be enhanced with high-level cybernetics! Have a look at the catalogues at the end of the book…\nTOUGH AS NAILS: you have accustomed your body to the most diverse exercises and pains. You have 15 extra life points.\nMILITARY TRAINING *: you have a +2 bonus to all your attack and damage rolls in close combat or at a distance, as you wish. You can buy this ability again to finish your training.",

You use characteristics as a bonus to all your rolls; by the way, they are used to calculate several counters and derivatives, such as hit points or defence.\n\nStrength\n\nAdd your rank for melee attacks and damage; all physical actions requiring power and energy.\n\nDexterity\n\nAdd your rank for ranged attacks and damage; all physical actions requiring flexibility, speed, hand skills and agility.\n\nConstitution\n\nAdd your rank for all physical actions requiring stamina and endurance; resist poisons, toxins, diseases and hard knocks. Each rank of Constitution gives 5 hit points. You can install a maximum of one cybernetic augmentation (see page 72) per Constitution rank - beyond that, you are constantly on the verge of cyberpsychosis.\n\nIntelligence\n\nAdd your rank for surfing the matrix for information; remembering knowledge and lore about all things in the world. Each Intelligence rank gives 1 point of connection. Intelligence also applies to initiative rolls.\n\nWisdom\n\nAdd your rank to stay alert, spot things, search a place. Each rank of Wisdom increases defence by 1 point.\n\nCharisma\n\nAdd your rank for chatting, convincing, seducing, sensing emotions and lying. Each rank of Charisma gives you 1 luck point.",

However, your identity, fingerprints and many biometric measurements are stored in government (IDC for civil identification) or corporate (IDO for orbital identification) databases - IDOs offer many more rights, but are extremely secure and monitored.\nIn the latter case, you are a second-class citizen, with no or extremely limited rights - but until you have been caught by the authorities and identified, you do not exist for anyone.\nOn page 98, you will find an ability that gives you a pirate IDC, if you wish to cheat gracefully.\n\n\nStarting equipment\nChoose your initial possessions from the three packs available: Action, Trick or Standing.

Most nexuses contain an advanced expert system, incorrectly called AI by the general public. The bonuses indicate the number of extra connection points that the nexus grants each day. The following prices allow you to upgrade your hardware if you wish.\n\n\n\nPRICE\nHARDWARE\n\n\n\n\n4¥\nBasic Nexus\n\n\n8¥\nNexus +1\n\n\n12¥\nNexus +3\n\n\n\n\n\nWeapons and protection\n\nWeapons and stealth\nThere are four degrees of stealth for these sensitive items:\nObvious: It is impossible to conceal the weapon in any way. Worse than that, it attracts attention.\nVisible: the weapon is clearly visible, although it is still possible to cover it under a coat, for example, to limit the risks - in which case it cannot be used.\nInvisible: the weapon is not directly visible. The wearer must be searched for it or it must pass through electronic detection systems.\nConcealed: the weapon is actively concealed and systems cover the risk of electronic tracking.\nThe Discreet option allows a weapon to be downgraded to a lower category.\nNote: normal weapons are effective against physical defence; similarly, the protections given here are physical protections and do not protect against magical attacks (if you use this game option, see page 303).\nDepending on your initial holdings, choose a ranged weapon from one of the following categories. Each additional weapon costs ¥8:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIREARM\nDAMAGE\nVISIBILITY\n\n\n\n\nHandgun\n+0\nInvisible\n\n\nAssault rifle and shotgun\n+3\nVisible\n\n\nPrecision rifle\n+3\nVisible (mounted), invisible (disassembled)\n\n\nAssault cannon and heavy machine gun\n+5\nObvious\n\n\n\nChoose a melee weapon from one of the one of the following categories.

You cannot have more augmentations than your constitution rank - otherwise, you are in cyberpsychosis.\nThere are five types of augmentations. Each grants you a basic function, but you can buy options for ¥4 each (see page 340). After character creation, installing a new augmentation costs ¥12.\n\nNeuronic\nNeuronics take advantage of the growth and discoveries of neuro-medicine and neural nano-repairers to more or less completely rewire an individual’s nervous system, to improve its overall functioning or to add new functions.\nNEURAL PLUG: You can operate any equipment with a neural plug to improve its efficiency. Generally, you get a +2 bonus on all associated rolls (indicated on the equipment), but it can also be a simple prerequisite to operate the equipment.\n\n\nNanogenetic\nThe engineering sciences have come a long way. The first generations of modified babies will soon be entering school with better genes than their parents (or so we hope, for we must still make do with vague promises). But the occupants of this time and space are too old to have enjoyed it. They are therefore content with the few genetic back-propagations that nanogenetics - the art of repairing cells from within - allows. These wealthy old men who are not finished with life are called immortals.\nREGENERATION: by spending one luck point, you recover all your life points.\n\n\nPanoptic\nYou have sensors all over your body.\nENHANCED SENSES: you have a +4 bonus to all perception rolls.\n\n\nProsthetic\nProsthetics involves replacing limbs, bones or skin with a mechanical equivalent made of synthetic materials or metal.\nPOWER: You have a +2 bonus to all Strength work, Endurance or Athletics checks, etc. In addition, choose a specific body replacement - Woven Skin, Lower Limb, Upper Limb, Bone Replacement - and note the associated bonus.\n\n\nReinforcement\nYou have been replaced, in bulk, with organs from the abdominal cavity and chest. This is more convenient and faster to operate.\nSTRENGTH: you have 10 extra life points.\n\n\nCosmetic\nCosmetic augmentations simply cost ¥2-4. There is no basic implant - it’s the equivalent of an ancient piercing or tattoo. All you need is a good address, a little time and a lot of money, at least if you want quality. Chrome eyes, electroluminescent tattoos, living inks, variable breast implants, hair modifications and other fashionable effects are all yours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONS\nAUGMENTATION\n\n\n\n\nRETINAL DISPLAY\nNexus connection pin for augmented reality retinal display. Extremely common - ¥2 in most cyber shops, installation in minutes and 24 hours of scheduled exercise.\n\n\nCAPILLILUMES\nHair emits coloured lights\n\n\nCAPILLITECH\nThe hair changes size and colour at will\n\n\nCUSTOM HAIR\nOptions: feathers, fur, quills, leaves, metal, optical fibres…\n\n\nPERFUME GLAND\nPrograms can be purchased from major cosmetic companies according to your wishes and tastes. Can contain from one to five programs depending on the model.\n\n\nIMPLANT SYNTHETICS\nSynthetics chip reader with fractal axon connections.\n\n\nVARIABLE BREAST IMPLANTS\nAdjustable for all situations - love, sport, work, going out, etc.\n\n\nCHROMATIC LENSES\nChange eye colour at will\n\n\nNANO-GROOMS\nSweat contains nano-machines that clean the skin and clothes so that you always look your best.\n\n\nCHROMATIC NAILS\nNails that change colour and length\n\n\nGLOWING TATTOO\nLuminous and moving dermal patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicles\nYou can of course buy vehicles for yourself. For more information on vehicles, see page 167.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nVehicle\nSpeed\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n12¥\nCPA CIVIL\nSlow\nCivilian self-contained personal suit - big mecha for young thrill-seekers or for power workers, express deliverymen and other urban workers.\n\n\n4¥\nURBAN TWO-WHEELS\nMedium\nScooters and other small motorbikes.\n\n\n8¥\nFAST MOTORCYCLE\nFast\nRacing motorbikes for messengers and gangsters.\n\n\n8¥\nURBAN ELECTRIC CAR\nSlow\nTwo seats, no trunk, easy to park in the city’s vertical car parks.\n\n\n12¥\nSUBURBAN CAR\nMedium\nFour-seater, tight, easy for drive-by-shooting and beach trips.\n\n\n14¥\nROAD CAR\nFast\nFive seats, powerful engine, aerodynamic bodywork.\n\n\n18¥\nDRIFT/FAST & FURIOUS CAR\nVery fast\nThe colourful kind with extra nitro and excess testosterone.\n\n\n16¥\nSUV\nFast\nHeavy, polluting, powerful, efficient, with plenty of room inside.

Choose your weapons and possibly some cybernetics.\nNevertheless, at the end of this book, you will find many additional options to improve your equipment - be it weapons, protection or augmentations - but also new toys such as vehicles, mechas and drug… sorry, chems. Beware, these are catalogues, which means that players will waste time searching and choosing. Only give them these lists if you have the time or if you play in a campaign.\n\n\nThe ¥\nCharacters earn ¥ every time they do a job (see page 244), pick an opponent’s pocket, negotiate the sale of recovered material, etc. It is always possible to create a fund for the sale of goods. It is always possible to create a common fund for all characters or to keep full possession of your ¥. You can either use the ¥ as you go along or keep them, for example by placing them in an account.\nA job well done should never yield more than ¥2 or ¥3 per character (pooled amount), but characters are encouraged to scrape what they can whenever possible - after all, fences are not for dogs. On the other hand, if they start looting anything and everything, the aftermath can get very interesting, when the authorities get involved or a powerful person tries to get their property back the hard way (have you seen Guy Ritchie’s films?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nEffect\n\n\n\n\n1¥\nYou gain +10 XP (see page 102)\n\n\n1¥\nYou buy a dose of accelerator (see page 372)\n\n\n2¥\nYou regain one luck point (see page 101)\n\n\n3¥\nYou find temporary equipment, such as a disposable weapon or nanodrones\n\n\n4¥\nYou buy an option for a vehicle or a increase\n\n\n6¥\nAND MORE You find important information about the following of the adventure\n\n\n8¥\nYou buy a weapon or medium protection\n\n\n12¥\nYou buy a new cybernetic augmentation or a vehicle\n\n\n\n\nLosing your equipment\nCharacters will gradually invest a lot of ¥ in their equipment. Generally speaking, consider that they don’t lose it easily, that they find it in nearby cupboards when they have been captured by enemies or that they can replace it identically via their contacts. Nevertheless, make them understand that the loss of equipment is a possible sanction if they do something stupid or if you are in a bad mood. And there, it doesn’t matter that they invested 50 ¥ in their Arcatech Grendel-6 to have all the options and the elephant ivory handle… And then, it can give rise to beautiful adventures when it will be necessary to go to recover the invaluable one at a big well protected villain.",

    "text": "Relationships\nYour character is not alone in life. He has many contacts, perhaps a few friends and possibly intimates. You will find all the specific rules for managing relationships on page 155 (asking for a favour, creating extras) and page 246 (returning the favour).\nYou have five relationship points that you can distribute among the different extras that the host suggests (or that you have created as a group) - each point allows you to increase a relationship to the chosen rank.\n\n\n\nRank\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nRELATIONSHIP\nContact\nFriend\nIntimate\n\n\n\nDuring the course of the game you will gain additional relationship ranks, either to open new contacts or to increase the rank of an existing relationship. The leader of the game distributes these ranks, taking into account your actual relationship, the way you behave, the help and services you provide to your contacts and friends, etc. A relationship may distance itself or disappear if you betray it or behave badly with it.\nUsually, gaining a first rank is quite easy: just meet the person, spend some time with them, do them a favour or simply make a good initial contact. It is the equivalent of exchanging phone numbers or virtual contact details. It’s likely that characters will quickly have a pretty impressive list of contacts - in fact, it’s often enough to decide to write the person’s name on the back of their character sheet - but that’s perfectly normal: a good cyberpunk’s first weapon is their nexus anyway. Once noted, it is often difficult to lose a contact.\nGaining the second rank is often a bit more difficult. The character needs to build trust and security with the relationship. They must have experienced things together, done favours for each other or shared common interests. This can happen quickly, and disappear just as quickly if the relationship is not maintained by regular contact that reinforces the impression of sharing a common living space. And at the slightest betrayal, things can fall apart.\nWinning the third rank requires a very significant personal investment. We are talking about intimacy here, because a character is willing to entrust his or her most personal secrets, his or her very life, to the relationship. As it is a relationship that requires a lot of investment in time and affect, it is likely that the character will have no more than one or two relationships at this level: a childhood friend, a life partner, a close relative, a mentor… Beware, an intimate relationship is often very solid and can withstand most of the blows of fate, but when it breaks, it is usually permanent and with heavy consequences for everyone.",

If you compare the 3d6 roll and the action difficulty scale (see page 111), it’s a really big advantage that might seem to throw the game off balance. In reality, this is not the case.\nOn the one hand, the skills are highly specialised. You don’t have Stealth, you have Hide in the Shadows, Blend in with the scenery or Move silently! The bonus only applies to very small slices of action.\nOn the other hand, the action success mechanic allows you to take advantage of very good successes to add “matrix” effects to the game (see Keeping the Show Going, page 115). And the opponents are not left out and benefit from the same advantages. Finally, let’s be clear: when you’re a player, you like to make big successes and explode everything, don’t you? What always limits this kind of fun in the game is the timidity of the game leader who simply doesn’t dare let go of the power of the characters for fear of losing control. But in reality, if he inscribes this apparent over-power in his game process, the leader risks absolutely nothing apart from a few beautiful over-the-top scenes and frank smiles from his players (who will fall all the more over the top when the harsh reality of the stories they are living and the Cornelian choices they have to make come to their attention).\n\nActing out\nAvoiding a nasty surprise\nBargaining with your fellow man\nBe convincing\nBeing brave\nBlend in with the background\nCaring for animals\nClimbing and climbing\nCoding and decoding\nComforting and consoling\nCook drugs\nCooking and seasoning\nDeciphering an architect’s plan\nDisarming security systems\nDisguise yourself skilfully\nDoing acrobatics\nDrawing and painting\nDriving a heavy vehicle\nDriving a light vehicle\nEvaluating an object\nFalsifying documents\nFilming and photographing\nFinding information\nFinding your way\nFly a flying machine\nFlying a mecha\nFollowing a lead\nHaggle hard\nHealing and sewing\nHiding in the shadows\nHold the pain\nInterrogating and questioning\nIntimidating and driving a car\nJumping high and far\nKnow a neighbourhood like the back of your hand\nKnowing about biology\nKnowing maths and physics\nKnowing your rights and navigating the legal system\nListening and hearing\nLocating an escape route\nLooking and spotting\nMounting a guard\nMove silently\nNegotiating a contract\nOpening locks\nPicking pockets\nPlaying an instrument\nPrescribing medicine\nReading emotions\nReading lips\nResisting toxins\nRiding a horse\nRiding a two-wheeler\nRun fast and long\nSearching a place\nSeduce and simper\nSwimming and diving\nTailgating\nTinkering with an electrical network\nTinkering with drones and mechas\nTinkering with electronic things\nTinkering with explosives\nTinkering with mechanical devices\nTouching a bit in IT\nWorking with plastec and carboconcrete\nWorking with wood, concrete and metal\nWriting legible texts\nYelling the loudest",

    "section": "Abilities",
    "text": "Abilities\nYour character has one or more abilities. Abilities marked with an * can be can be purchased more than once either to increase their power, or so that you can activate them more than once per cycle.\nThe damage dice offered by the abilities are never explosive.\nASSISTANCE: When you use a manoeuvre to help a comrade, you grant a bonus equal to your Wisdom instead of the simple +1.\nRECOVERY INSURANCE: You have full life insurance. The company that insures you will come and get you wherever you are if your vital functions drop - for example when you remain at 0 life points for more than a few minutes in a row or when you suffer your third injury (you set the level of sensitivity of the alarm).\nHEALTH INSURANCE *: Your insurance covers the hospital costs of one injury per cycle.\nSNEAK ATTACK *: Once per battle, double the damage you inflict in close combat or at a distance (the result of the die plus the bonus). You can announce the use of this ability after making the attack roll.\nATTENTION TO DETAIL: This ability is permanent. When a security system goes off because you weren’t paying attention properly, roll 1d6: on 4 or more, you’ve spotted the system in time and it doesn’t go off before you can do something about it.\nAUTHORITY: You have a position of responsibility in an organisation - corporation, criminal organisation, NGO, security services, etc. You have all the prerogatives of an authority. You have all the prerogatives of an executive, but also the obligations to the hierarchy and internal rules.\nINVISIBLE BULLET *: once per combat, you can fire a projectile at a hidden or invisible target, within sight (and therefore possibly beyond the range of the weapon). The projectile ignores obstacles (such as a door, wall or billboard).\nTINKERER: You’re always in your workshop tinkering with stuff and you never go out without a whole range of useful little gadgets. Spend a connection point to gain a +1 bonus on a roll that may involve the use of technology; to dig up a little something to trade for information or a service; or to quickly (and temporarily) repair a broken item.\nCHIP BURNER: you spend your time modifying your nexus to make it more efficient. You get two extra connection points per day.\nCELEBRITY : You are famous. This allows you to earn 1d6 ¥ per at the end of each cycle, thanks to advertising contracts. People recognise you on 1d6 if the result is equal to or less than the number of * - which can be an advantage in many situations.\nINSOLENT LUCK: You have insolent luck. You get two extra luck points each round.\nTWO-WEAPON FIGHTING: You are able to handle two weapons at the same time (e.g. pistol and/or blade). This gives you a +1 bonus to defence and a +3 bonus to damage - your attacks make enemies look down and you provide good group shots.\nCONTACTS *: You have contacts in one of the following circles - security forces, administration, criminal organisations, health services, transport authorities, media and entertainment, corporations, magical orders. Once per cycle, you can call on a service or information in the environment for free, as if it were an intimate relationship - the rest of the time, spend connection points as normal for a single contact.\nMULTIPLE DRONES *: If you are a wired person, you may simultaneously ride an additional drone for each ability you take. In all cases, you can only wire to one vehicle at a time, but with this ability, you can ride both a vehicle and one or more drones.\nDESERTED PLACE: You have the keys to a quiet place, whether it’s deserted or the people there don’t care what you’re up to. It can be abandoned warehouses, the underground vaults of the giant rainwater system, a slum under the bridges. You can solve all your problems there, invite people, hide things, store goods. As long as you don’t leave a corpse behind, you’re pretty much free to do whatever you want there - including making said corpses.\nAKASHIK SPIRIT: You can choose an akashic spirit - a digital entity that hangs out in the matrix and follows, helps and sometimes protects you. However, it tends to require some regular service - simple suggestions, mind you, but from someone you feel obliged to oblige (see page 149).\nFORTUNATE *: You have access to large amounts of money for specific expenditures, whether it be through a pension fund, loans from an overly kind grandmother, a helping hand from an underworld kingpin who has you on the hook… Once a cycle, you may make a very large expenditure - renting a race car, a small boat or a large luxury flat, hosting a large reception, buying a valuable present for someone, etc. What you buy or rent disappears at the end of the cycle.\nWARDROBE: you always have the right clothes for every occasion - whether it’s a dinner at the CEO’s house of a big corporation or an expedition to the mountains in winter. You’re never caught unprepared and when you take care of yourself, you get a +2 bonus to your rolls.\nDEADLY GRACE: You add twice your Dexterity bonus to the damage you inflict at range.\nBIG BULLY: Add twice your Strength bonus to the damage you deal in close combat.\nMULTITOOL: You have a very useful universal tool. You have a +2 circumstantial bonus when the tool can be used - to fix something, tinker with a junction box, tamper with an engine or sabotage a machine.\nNANODRONES: You have an army of nanodrones that you can unleash at any time to perform certain tasks: environmental analysis, beaconing, microcavity exploration, spying, etc. The results of their operations are left to your discretion. The outcome of their operations is left to the discretion of the game leader, who may or may not use the golden rule - there are too many variables and possible cases to attempt to write exhaustive rules here about these machines and the countermeasures that can be applied to them (EMP discharges, faraday cages and other nanodrones, for example).\nNANOPRINTER: You have a portable 3D printer. You can create objects or tools with nanoparticles, if you already have the design or if you can scan a model. The printing time is usually quite short, but still counts in minutes. After each use, roll 1d6 - on a result of 1, you cannot use the nanoprint until the end of the cycle, while it recharges.\nENHANCED NEXUS [attack]: when rolling to test an opponent’s firewall, roll two dice instead of one and consider which one you want.\nENHANCED NEXUS [biomonitor]: You have 10 extra hit points.\nENHANCED NEXUS [environmental filters]: Your nexus allows you to analyse a scene or situation using a variety of filters - crime scene analysis, searching for details in a crowd, searching a location, etc. You have a +2 bonus to the environmental filter. You have a +2 bonus to Wisdom rolls.\nENHANCED NEXUS [firewall]*: Your nexus and wired systems are protected with a level 2 firewall. You can use this ability multiple times to increase your firewall by 1, to a maximum of 5.\nEHANCED NEXUS hacker*: Your nexus is equipped to hack systems. For one point of connection, you can decrease the value of an opposing firewall by 1. You can take this ability up to three times in total, allowing you to decrease the value of a firewall by 3 for one connection point.\nENHANCED NEXUS [facial recognition]: When facing someone you don’t know, roll 1d6. On a result of 4+, your nexus tells you some information available on social networks about them.\nEHANCED NEXUS [universal translator]: your nexus translates for you all conversations in languages you don’t understand. It’s not always pretty or even very accurate, but it gets you by.\nPARKOUR: You have learned the secret arts of urban travel, the subtle way of dashing through streets and buildings using every obstacle to propel yourself and change direction. In dense urban environments, you move at the average speed of a civilian vehicle - this counts mainly for long journeys, thanks to the shortcuts you can afford to take. For short or tactical moves, double your movement speed.\nLIGHT STEPS: This ability is permanent. You move with a light step. You are naturally quite quiet when you move; you can go where others who are heavier would never venture; you can walk or run longer with less fatigue…\nCORPORATE PORTFOLIO : You invest in the stock market. This allows you to earn ¥1d6 per at the end of each cycle, thanks to your judicious investments and depending on the behaviour of the markets.\nFIRST AID *: Spend one life point and heal two of your companions. This is not an action, but you must be by their side. Each time you buy this ability again, you heal two extra hit points for every one spent. If you have the Heal and Stitch skill, add 1d6 hit points to those you confer with this ability.\nEMP PROTECTION *: Your entire electronic and cybernetic team is protected from one EMP discharge per cycle. When you suffer the effects of such an attack, it simply ceases to function until the end of the scene, with no further damage.\nSAFE HAVEN: You have a safe haven where no one will ever come looking for you - a hideout in the depths of the slums, a flat in someone else’s name in the middle of an enclave. It’s up to you what you leave behind in terms of useful materials and resources, just in case. It’s also up to you whether you leave a spare key with someone you trust or not.\nSTORAGE CACHE: you have a well-protected place where you can leave resources, unique equipment, valuable items - the kind of little things you don’t leave lying around. It could be a trunk in the back of a drugstore, or it could be in the care of the foster uncle who raised you and won’t tell anyone, or it could be in the trunk of a very specific wreck in the middle of a huge junkyard. What is certain is that you have several routes to and from it and that you have systems in place to prevent your cache from being discovered.\nRETREAT: there’s a place you go to rest, recharge, catch up with old friends who are outside your current life - a bar, a strip joint, a barber’s waiting room, a bathhouse, your booty call’s bedroom. When you can spend some time there, regain a point of luck.\nVIRTUAL LIVING ROOM: you have a virtual living room on the matrix, well protected by the necessary means. You don’t have to worry about being discovered or spied on. You can meet up with people via the matrix and discuss whatever you want in peace.\nCONSULTANCY SERVICES *: you have access to a firm of specialists who can provide you with specific but pointed assistance, once a cycle, in any of the following areas: legal representation, contract negotiations, close protection services, event organisation, documentary research, file analysis, transport logistics, etc.\nPIRATE IDC *: You have a pirate IDC that transmits a false identity. Each time you are caught and this identity is compromised or destroyed, you must pay ¥4 to restore it at the end of the cycle. This ability works whether you already have an official IDC or IDO or not. It’s not usually possible to make a fake IDO - but that can be an adventure in itself if you really need it, for example to go incognito in the moon islands…\nLIGHT SLEEP: This power is permanent. You sleep with one eye open. No one can catch you sleeping and you are always fresh and alert when you wake up.\nTOUGHNESS: If you fall to 0 hit points, you do not fall unconscious and can continue to act. However, each additional attack that hits you automatically inflicts a point of injury as long as you remain at 0 hit points or if you fall back to 0 hit points.",

Each point of injury reduces your maximum hit points by 5.

Of course, characters can always try to negotiate the cost with their employers.\nWhen a cycle passes (see page 102), each character clears 1d3 wounds.\n\nHealing: a character can always attempt an Intelligence roll, with the appropriate skill bonuses, against a difficulty of 15. The result of the coloured die indicates the number of hit points recovered. Each connection point spent on the roll increases this result by 2. Each ¥ increases the result by 5.

    "text": "Roll the dice\nTo play, you need 3d6, one of which is a different colour from the others.\nWhen you want to achieve a goal and something or someone gets in the way, roll the 3d6, add up the results and add the rank of an appropriate characteristic - for example Dexterity to blow out a lock with a knife blade or Wisdom to locate the drug stash under a floorboard. Don’t forget any bonuses - such as a skill bonus.\nTo succeed, the total must be equal to or greater than a difficulty or an opposing roll made by an opponent or competitor who does not want you to succeed - in which case they roll 3d6 + Attribute (see page 295) and the results are compared. For a fixed difficulty, see the following table:\n\n\n\nTarget number\nDifficulty\n\n\n\n\n9\nSimple\n\n\n12\nDifficult\n\n\n15\nDifficult\n\n\n18\nVery hard\n\n\n21\nExtremely difficult\n\n\n24\nAlmost impossible\n\n\n\n\nThe delicate art of dice rolling\nThe principle of a roll is to confront a character’s abilities with the possibility that they may fail to achieve their goals; the purpose of the roll is certainly not to punish them or prevent them from moving forward, but only to tell how the story is progressing. If it is a success, then the character succeeds and the story moves in the direction he wants; on a failure, the story takes an unexpected turn. And we continue to move forward: the player indicates what his character does in the new circumstances and the leader determines how it happens, with a description, a choice to be made and possibly a new dice roll.\n\nThe dice are useless…\nIf there is nothing in the character’s way, or if it doesn’t matter, there is no need to roll - it is automatically successful. And, of course, if the task is simply impossible to accomplish, it is automatically failed. More generally, if you don’t have a good reason to invoke a random bifurcation of history, don’t ask for a roll - ideally, you should have at least a vague idea of the different legs of the trousers of time that you might put on depending on the circumstances.\n\n\n…yet you can’t do without them\nIf something or someone complicates the task, opposes the character, or makes things very complicated, you have to roll the dice. The game leader must then assess the difficulty: there are two schools of thought.\n\nThe first is to choose an objective difficulty. The action is more or less difficult because the circumstances or the task itself require it: try to imagine the scene, compare the action to your own knowledge or to what you have seen in films or read in novels. Generally, the more technical the task, the more circumstances beyond the control of a single human beast, the more random the general conditions, the more difficult it is.\nThe second school is to determine the difficulty in terms of the story. If the task can change the story and the world profoundly, then the difficulty is huge; if it’s just an incidental and peripheral perk, then the difficulty is ridiculous. It’s a hair more complicated to deal with and anything but objective - plus, players can quickly realise that a difficulty of 24 to tail an extra in a trendy nightclub indicates that he’s a super-important big bad next!\n\nAnd, of course, you can happily mix and match approaches depending on when you play. The important thing is to be consistent with yourself, the world and the story.\n\n\n\nThe secret ingredient\nYou know how to manage the difficulty of an action in an opposition - for example, two characters racing. In this case, the difficulty of the roll is the opponent’s roll (3d6 + Power for an extra). What’s to stop you doing the same for a static difficulty: instead of saying “it’s a 15 difficulty”, the difficulty to pick the lock is then equal to 3d6 + 4. Maybe the lock is a hair easier or a hair harder than you expected. This is handy when you don’t know what to do or want to go fast. Just assume that chaos will make the decision for you…\n\n\nEnsure the show\nOnce the roll has been made, it’s time to announce the consequences. If it’s a success, the character achieves his immediate goal, as the player might expect under the best of circumstances. If the roll is really good - a result well above the difficulty, at least a five or six point margin - add a matrix effect: the character runs around bouncing off obstacles and street furniture while chasing a bad guy; the computer quickly spits out all the info it can and gives access to hidden backdoors to go even further; the checkpoint passage is so smooth that the character is suddenly the most innocent guy in the world. Give them a little advantage in this form: it’s time saved, it’s stealth, it’s downright impressed witnesses, it’s extra ¥, it’s clues or additional information, etc.\n\n\nEnsure that the game continues\nWhat if it fails? The biggest danger you face then is driving your story into a dead end. The character aims for a goal and misses it: now what? If it’s just “no”, the story can’t develop. So it is very important that you see all failures not as a punishment, but as an opportunity, a way to bounce back and offer unexpected developments. Also, be careful that a failure is not immediately forgotten: there is nothing more frustrating than attempting an action that serves no purpose, even and especially by failing - as a feeling of uselessness and futility for the player.\nHow do you do it? The quickest way is to grant a success but demand something in return: the character gets hurt, compromises himself, loses time, material, money, has to agree to do a service, etc. Be imaginative and hit where you feel the player will cringe. Very important: the player can always choose to fail so that they don’t have to agree to pay to succeed! The easiest way to do this is often to tap into resources: lose life points, luck points, connection points, etc. But it is always more interesting to find original ideas. In reality, the purpose of such an exchange is to push the player to choose between the plague and the cholera: succeed with a cost or simply fail? Don’t make it too simple, but demand a quick answer.\nThe second way is to take advantage of a failure to complicate things and put new obstacles in the character’s way. Not a wall, but a closed door. Not a bottomless precipice, but an unstable ledge from which it is difficult to escape. Not a cut bridge, but a long diversions. Not the loss of all one’s money, but debts that must be repaid one day. Not an outright capture, but a price on your head. In short, continue to ruin the character’s life and prevent him from seeing the sun. Accumulate the problems.\nOr, more foolishly, require the player to play with his brain and find alternative and more subtle solutions…\n\n\nDescribe, there will always be something left\nOne of the best ways to always have something to say to bounce back from a failure or bring in new twists is to describe the scenes all over the place! Think of sights, sounds, smells, textures, weather, materials, the shape of places, decorative details, lights and shadows - anything you can think of. Not only does this immerse the players in the appropriate atmosphere and give them plenty of relevant (or irrelevant) information to make decisions and describe the actions of their characters, but it’s also great for giving you, the player, a head start. Use your own descriptions, on the fly, to create play and set up the twists and turns the dice are designed to provide.",

    "text": "Saves\nIn the course of adventures, your adventurer will certainly find himself in delicate and dangerous situations, facing multiple dangers: fire, falls, diseases, poisons, traps, etc.\nA saving throw is a characteristic throw requested by the game leader to check whether the character manages to protect himself, at least in part, from a sudden danger or a vital threat. It is always a reaction and not something that comes from the character’s will (even when the character has voluntarily swallowed the contents of a bottle of poison). The characteristic used depends on the type of danger and there are a few skills that should help you.\nThe difficulty depends on the circumstances, but mostly on what the player wants to achieve:\n\nEasy or hard (9/12): you want to scare them.\nDifficult to hard (15/18): you want to tap into the characters’ resources to weaken them.\nComplicated or impossible (21/24): you ask for a saving throw to make the characters think they have a chance, but in fact they don’t. It’s not expected that they’ll make it (even if there are some pleasant surprises).\n\nIf the character fails the roll, the effects of the danger apply. If he succeeds, the effects may be completely nullified or only limited (he does not die on the spot, but still suffers damage or injury, for example).\nThere are far too many possible hazards to list - from electric fences to terrifying corporate interface lockout programs, from combat gases to sudden explosions. Just try to think about the maximum consequences of the hazard (injury, death, unconsciousness, damage, etc.) and what can happen if the character succeeds in the saving throw.",

    "title": "Rules of the game",
    "section": "Combat",
    "text": "Combat\nAction and Manoeuvre - Combat is turn-based - each opponent can perform an action (cast a spell, make an attack, use a skill) and a manoeuvre (move a few metres, take cover, aim, charge, help an ally, etc.). - A manoeuvre used in support of an action brings a +1 bonus to the action). It is always possible to use an action to perform a manoeuvre, but never vice versa.\nMovement: if you need to calculate the exact distance a character has moved during a turn, ask for a Strength (all power) or Dexterity (all flexibility) roll. The result directly indicates the distance in metres.\nInitiative - Once at the start of a fight, all combatants can make an Intelligence roll (or Power roll for extras) to determine the order of the action, from highest initiative to lowest. If, at any time, your initiative is 20 or more, you gain an extra action at the end of the turn (at your initiative minus 20). If one group surprises another, all members of the group get a +1d6 bonus to initiative.\n\nIf you don’t want the players to see the transition between the story being told informally and the start of a fight, don’t say anything and roll the initiative in secret. Then simply distribute the word. Ideally, you should get the initiative bonus for each character and make several draws in advance, before the game starts. Then you simply refer to your notes when you need them. Don’t forget to note the initiative increases and decreases due to feats and risks.\n\nAttacks and damage - The difficulty of an attack roll is equal to your opponent’s defence. If you hit, the damage is equal to the value of the different coloured die + your Strength or Dexterity rank, depending on the weapon you are using (melee or ranged). The damage is subtracted from the target’s hit points. The coloured die is always an explosive die for calculating damage: if you roll a 6, roll the die again and add the new result. Continue as long as you get 6’s. You can always distribute the damage to one or more opponents whose defence is equal to or less than that of the main target.\nSpecial rules: there are dozens of specific cases that can arise in combat - whether the opponent is under cover or not, whether it is possible to disengage without taking a hit, whether it is possible to block a path so that only one opponent at a time can attack, whether I can shoot into the fray while my companions are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, etc. In fact, every battle should bring up new issues and new tactics. But it is impossible (and pointless) to list them all and give a specific rule for each. In truth, this is the fundamental job of the game leader, the moment when he must fully assume his role: to referee, to make decisions, to use the golden rule, to make the players happy or on the contrary to increase the difficulties. If you make a bad decision once, it means you will make two very good ones later - so don’t worry. The rules are simple enough that you have nothing to worry about. Trust your common sense and just follow the directions given to you by the story and the adventure.\n\nFeats and Risks\nEach round of combat, you can choose a feat. The host rolls the risk you take in exchange… If a risk seems directly opposite to the feat you are choosing, ignore the risk and apply the feat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEAT\n1D6\nRISK\n\n\n\n\nVIOLENT HIT: You add 1d6 to your physical damage. This damage is non-explosive and does not apply to spells.\n1\nDEFLECTED HIT: You do not count the coloured die in your damage, only the applicable modifiers, or (at your discretion) you take damage yourself equal to the smallest die you rolled.\n\n\nPRECISE STRIKE: You seek to break through the opponent’s armour.You have a +2 bonus to attack.\n2\nDISADVANTAGE: You have a -2 malus to attack or you lose a connection point.\n\n\nCASCADE: You perform an additional manoeuvre at the same time as your action.\n3\nBLUNDER: If you fail your attack, things get very complicated: you lose your weapon, you fall, etc.\n\n\nCAUTION: You are careful. You have a bonus of +1 in defence for the turn.\n4\nHAZARD: You are not paying attention. You have -1 in defence for the turn.\n\n\nVIVACITY: You gain 1d6 initiative points.\n5\nDELAY: You lose 1d6 initiative points.\n\n\nTACTICS: You give a +2 bonus to one of your companions.\n6\nNONE: You are not hindered this turn and your feat applies without compensation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStaging a fight\nHere are some tips to help you stage a fight (or a physical chase-type conflict).\n\nGeneral process\nBy following these steps, you should be fine in all situations.\n\nOn his own initiative, the player indicates what he wants to do according to the situation and his tactical options. Everything is possible and he should not let himself be limited by technique. Eventually, he can choose a feat.\nThe leader chooses the most appropriate way to handle what the player is asking for. This may be a characteristic roll (the most common is the attack roll, for example) or a simple description. You should not be impressed by even the strangest requests. For example, let’s say the character wants to push an enemy away with his shoulder and throw him through a window - it’s not written in black and white in the rules, but you can consider it a Strength roll. The damage rolled on the coloured die (with the Strength bonus) is not actually inflicted, but can be compared, for example, to the sum of the enemy’s hit points and those of the window. If they are higher, the window shatters and the man falls through - and if they are lower, ask the victim for a saving throw! In fact, everything can be solved in a very simple way - whether it’s disarming an opponent or shoving them into a hole, with attack rolls against the defence. Is the character making a feint to divert attention? Use Charisma to attack. He wants to drive his opponent over a weak floor? Use Intelligence to attack. Damage is a general indication of the effect of the attack - which you can turn into a difficulty for a saving throw quite simply (for example, with a difficulty of 7 + damage).\nThe player rolls if necessary.\nThe leader describes the consequences, says what happens, deals damage if necessary or bounces the action. Then he passes to the next player. Of course, this is exactly the same process for the characters’ opponents (but the leader is on his own to decide things).\n\n\n\nThree important points of combat\n\nI. Stakes:\nA fight is not something you engage in to pass the time. It is a high point in the story - the characters will risk their resources or their lives, perhaps worse. Even their opponents take the matter very seriously - after all, they are likely to lose their lives. In fact, in most situations, one does not go into battle without strong needs or clear objectives. In some cases, it is the characters who will have to define these objectives; in other cases, they will simply defend themselves against opponents who themselves have goals to achieve. The important point is to always ask what is at stake in a fight: why are we fighting? Do we have to go as far as the physical elimination of the opponent? Is it not enough to wound, stun, chase, intimidate or coerce? What if the enemy flees? Do you chase them to the finish or are you magnanimous? Fighting in a role-playing game is then also a lesson in humanity… Conversely, what do the characters risk? What are they willing to risk? It’s pretty obvious that they will be victorious most of the time, after all aren’t they the heroes of the story… But to win without glory is to triumph without danger (or something like that). Also, a fight must be able to cost: time, allies, wounds, equipment, information, reputation… The players know, deep down, that the death of their character is not a real possibility as they have so many ways to get out of it (by spending luck points or simply because they are not alone). Also, it is very important that other elements emerge that make the fight “dangerous” for their mission or adventure: most of the time, it is about seeing their objective escape. Also, play their opponents intelligently: they are not cannon fodder who die stupidly. If the characters want something, their enemies will do whatever it takes to get it out of their hands, and sometimes that means dodging the fight, running away or creating diversions.\n\n\nII. Descriptions:\nA fight is first of all a series of important choices grouped together in a very short period of time. There is an objective to fulfil and you have to do everything (or almost everything) to achieve it - free prisoners, steal or break an object, get through a defended area, flee in good order. It’s rarely a case of slaughtering all your enemies, but rather a specific target. To make these choices, you need to be informed and it is the job of the game leader to inform his players: describe the terrain, the circumstances, the actions, the reactions, the twists and turns, the audience, the surprises, the equipment, the physical and emotional state of the opponents, etc. In fact, the more detail you can provide, the easier it will be to manage the actions of the characters (the little 2 and 4 above) and the easier it will be for the players to make decisions quickly (the little 1 above). This doesn’t mean going off on a tangent or being fussy, just giving all the relevant tactical information. Two last important points: on the one hand, the players must be told, in a clear and unambiguous way, “You can win this fight” or “Run away, you fools! The players can’t guess whether the opposition they are facing is up to them or not. You need to send clear and unambiguous messages, without telling them head-on (which would pull them out of the immersion). This means using appropriate descriptions and multiple clues, including alternative ways out. On the other hand, the players must be able to participate in the descriptions and thus establish facts that are verified. Before an ambush, for example, if they ask what the terrain is like, ask them to tell you what they want it to be like: after all, they are the ones setting up the ambush and therefore they are the ones choosing the location. And then, in the course of the fight, they can find places to hide, to slip away, to corner the opponent. Let them announce that they are hiding behind a table that didn’t exist a few moments before - in truth, nobody paid any attention to it. Now you too can use this table in the descriptions.\n\n\nIII. Pacing:\nTry to keep the flow of speech relatively even. This sometimes means cutting off a character’s action, on a cliffhanger, to focus on another part of the battlefield and another character. Push your players to react quickly, to pass the word, to listen to each other - there’s nothing worse than a player who looks up in the middle of a fight and says “Yeah, wait, here, go ahead, tell me again what’s going on, where am I?” There’s no point in punishing stupid actions or unfortunate initiatives. But inattention can be worth losing your turn! On your side, be careful not to push your players into inattention because you are spending too much time on a technicality or reviewing your notes or the rules. Make decisions when you don’t know. At worst, roll the golden rule die. No one will replay the game or judge your refereeing mistakes; and if you think you’ve misjudged a situation or wronged a character, you’ll make up for it the next time (by giving them a small bonus or a point of luck back). Pacing is also about technique. Have clear notes in front of you, with the life points, defence and initiative of the opponents; also, draw a square representing the game table. Arrange the names of the characters in the place of their players, and indicate their defence and initiative. When you hand out the floor, call out the players by their character’s name. Make quick rolls for the opponents, compare to the defence, announce the result and how the conflict continues. A solid organisation of your post-it notes and numbers can help you speed up the manoeuvre. Ah. Still, a tip not to be overlooked: just as you write down the names of the characters so you only use those and not the players’, write down the names or descriptions of the opponents - the Little Fat Guy, the Big Skinny Guy, the Scarfed Guy, Studded Armour, Big Hair, Big Mouth, etc. This will help you to immerse your players. On the other hand, if you’re not going to tell your players that the strange shadow that’s attacking them is The Priest, a techno-villain who’s behind a spate of horrific murders, don’t write down The Priest, just Strange Shadow. Because if you don’t, there will always be a moment when, after reading the paper, you’ll spill the beans and your players will look at you with a big smile: “Ah, of course it’s The Priest! The guy we’ve been looking for everywhere!”",

The program runs and the alarm ignores you. Nevertheless, you lose all your remaining connection points.\nDIVERSION OF COMMUNICATIONS: You misuse a communication in such a way that you answer it yourself or do not complete it.\nGEOLOCATION: You divert the target’s geolocation information so that you always know their location.\nQUICK GLANCE: You access a person’s personal information recorded on their nexus. The amount of information naturally depends on the target’s attitude towards his presence (or discretion) on the matrix.\nMETAMORPHOSIS: You change your appearance in augmented reality - costume, appearance, size, gender, etc. The illusion only works for those who see the world in this way.

The alarm roll receives a -1 modifier.\nCONTROL OF A MACHINE: You take control of a local machine (manipulator arm, vehicle, robot, etc.) to make it perform simple tasks.\nLISTEN: After hacking into the target’s nexus, you can listen in on their live conversations as long as you are within range.\nILLUSION: You change the perceptions of a person connected to the augmented reality to add or remove elements of the setting - the details must be minor and consistent.\nCAMERA PLAYBACK: You retrieve recent data from local cameras (up to hours earlier). The retrieval concerns cameras of all kinds present in an area not exceeding the size of a block.\nSECURITY RESET: You reboot your nexus at maximum speed to cancel all programs that target or affect you - you need a full turn during which you are no longer connected to the matrix.\nDECOY: You send false data to machines or cameras that get false information and act accordingly.\nTAMPERED SIGNAL: You add data to a communication signal.\nNETWORK MONITORING: You display in augmented reality the communication patterns between individuals and between individuals and machines, in order to identify functional groups. You need to be in the area and the links are displayed live in your field of view.\n\n\n\nLevel 3\n\nANONYMISATION: An alarm roll receives a modifier of -3.\nJAMMING: You saturate or jam communications in the area, causing a mess. You automatically trigger an alarm (roll 1d6 with a -3 modifier).\nEMBEZZLEMENT: You transfer funds from one account to another. Beware, this is the kind of operation that is anything but discreet and leaves traces for other coders like you. Sound the alarm immediately.\nINVISIBILITY: You disappear from the target’s augmented reality devices. The target has to switch back to normal vision, disconnect from the matrix or trigger specific monitoring programs to become aware of your real presence - but if they were unaware of your presence, they are unlikely to think about it.\nACCESS RESTRICTED DATA: The programme allows you to access databases normally out of reach of the public - administrative files, corporate files, etc. Beware: the program grants you access but does not carry out searches for you (make a skill roll); moreover, this is always a time-consuming operation and can block you for several turns, minutes or even hours.\nHACKING OF INTERFACED SYSTEMS: You take control of an interfaced system at an opponent’s location. The target is forced to use this hardware until they can perform a reset (they only roll 2d6 for all related rolls).\n\n\n\nLevel 4\n\nNETWORK CONTROL: You take control of the network and can allow or disallow communications and data transfers according to the filters you set up. Roll 1d6 every minute below the number of minutes to see if you trigger an alarm.\nDECRYPTAGE: You decrypt passwords, encrypted files, etc. - the firewall of an opposing system has a -1 malus for the rest of the scene, allowing you to control it more easily. You can activate this program several times to cumulate its effects, including from several different consoles (if several characters act together).\nPROTECTED IDENTITY: In addition to its normal activation cost, this programme costs ¥5 each time it is activated. As long as the programme is activated (including over several successive cycles), you benefit from a secondary protected identity on the matrix. Any request for identification or data about you is directed to this secondary identity. If adversary programs identify you, they burn this identity and you escape prosecution - you will have to restart the program and pay for its use.\nSATURATION: You saturate a person’s augmented reality receivers by drowning them in spam and attack ads. They must log out for the rest of the scene to reset their connection.\n\n\n\nLevel 5\n\nCOUNTERORDER: You cancel an alarm that has just been triggered.\nDESTRUCTION: You operate a complete network collapse over an area equivalent to a block. All communications are interrupted and the secondary and alert management systems start up.\nWORM: You install a worm in a system. The worm performs one of the following tasks, defined during installation:\n\nBACKDOOR: If you return to this system, the firewall is lowered by one level - even after several cycles. You should still activate your programs normally.\nSCREENING: The worm installs itself on the passage of wealth and takes a tiny part of it and gives it back to you at the end of the cycle - in the form of 1d6 ¥. Beware: this worm is particularly visible and corporations always react extremely badly when they discover the theft.\nSUPERVISION: The worm records all changes to the system files and sends a report at the end of each scene if necessary.\n\n\n\n\nSpecial programs\nCHANGING DATA: You change data in the memories of a system, either to erase it or to corrupt it. The cost depends on the type of data and the type of changes - from 2 to 5 connection points.\nDATA FUNNEL: You run a program with specific instructions to sort and capture the most interesting data in a system. The cost is variable depending on the purpose of the searches. This program is often used in conjunction with Read Reserved Data.",

    "text": "Building relationships\nCharacters have one or more relationships (see page 80) and can spend their connection points to activate them, in order to get their help. You can, of course, modulate the spending of connection points according to the circumstances: have the characters helped the relationship lately or done it a favour? Is the service a little more or less important than expected, etc.? If the request is directly related to the services offered by the contact (see page 158), feel free to lower the price a notch.\nPrint and cut out the portraits of the extras at the end of this booklet.\nWhen creating the group (see page 21), the leader divides these portraits among the players present. Each player eliminates a figure that he or she does not like, and then distributes his or her cards among his or her neighbours in order to repeat the elimination process. When each player has only two portraits left, the leader shuffles them and deals them out again.\nThe players then write down a trait for each portrait - it is best to use a post-it note. A line can be an adjective, an opinion, a complete sentence, a quote, etc. The idea is to characterise as best you can what the portrait inspires. When each picture has received a first trait, the players distribute the cards between their neighbours (one card to the right, one card to the left) and then define new traits for the figures they have chosen. new lines for the figures they have received.\nWhen all portraits have received two strokes, they are placed in the middle of the table. The players take each figure one after the other and, together, give it a name, an occupation, a short story, psychological traits and the reason why the characters might know it. You can also associate between one and three services with him, specifying his areas of activity and intervention in a specific way, in order to link them to the activities of the characters (see the following table).\nThe game leader can then complete these portraits on his own, on the spot or at rest, by developing a history of the relationship - its secrets, its motivations, its links with other extras, its allegiances to certain factions, its short or long term objectives, etc. He can then give the additional information that he wants to know about the relationship. He can then give the players any additional information he wishes or keep it to himself.\nBLACK MARKET: The relationship can supply or sell materials to the characters - illicit materials, discounted prices, usually specialising in one or two specific areas, but the black market as a whole remains accessible.\nENTRANCES: The relationship has entrances to all the important places in the city and can lead you there - a backstage pass, a corporate luncheon, a meeting at the town hall…\nINFORMATION: The relationship may provide information in one or more areas - it may be technical information or news about news about factions or neighbourhoods.\nINTERVENTION: The relationship is ready to give you a hand in the field, even if it means getting a little dirty. The more dangerous it is, the more compensation it will demand, but it knows how to behave and knows a few useful tricks.\nTRANSPORT: The relationship can transport characters from one point to another in various conditions, whether it is to go fast or to be discreet. It can also transport equipment, messages and cargo. It has, of course, specialities that influence its preparation or its prices.\nMATRIX: The relationship works in the matrix from home - or a secure location. If you don’t have a coder in the team or if you want to support them, the programmer can do the work remotely, unless you give them a more specific job.\nFENCE: The relationship can buy back material from characters - weapons, vehicles, jewellery, credit card laundering, etc. Fences are rarely fussy, but they will pay more in areas they are good at and less in areas where their costs will rise quickly due to lack of quick and easy outlets.\nREFUGE: The relationship can provide you with a safe haven for a variable amount of time, with all the comforts if you are wealthy enough and even medical facilities in case of major concern. As long as you are under his protection, no one will find you unless he betrays you.\nCONNECTIONS: The relationship is a node in a complex and extensive social network. His job is to connect people with each other, either on his own or on request. If you want to meet a particular person, that’s who you should go to.\nADVICE: The relationship is a mentor and protector for the characters.",

    "text": "Spiel and eloquence\nRole-playing is a dialectic game, even a maieutic one, since the entire table gives birth to a story that no one knows what it will be a priori. It is a game in which language, speech, plays a decisive role. This is not without its paradoxes. Indeed, one rarely expects a player playing the role of a knight armed to the teeth to know how to handle a sword and lead a horse into battle - he describes his attacks verbally and it is the dice that decide the final result. But what about when the action in play, such as chatting up a security guard, can also be an action around the table, with the player speaking through his character’s mouth to bamboozle the guard, and thus performing the manoeuvre himself - the player is of course in charge of the content of the chat, but it is the character who is the medium in play: he is the one who has the body language, the ability to lie straight to his face, etc.\nThis is an extremely thorny issue that has occupied pages and pages of discussion since the origin of role-playing. Everyone has their own opinions, solutions and practices. In fact, there is one specific term, which sums up all these discussions: it is roleplay - and, of course, no one agrees on its exact definition but everyone uses it to describe their ideal way of playing.\nIt is not our intention to resolve these paradoxes or even to give a definitive opinion, just to draw your attention to a few concerns you may have in play and to sketch out some answers that you can take hold of.\n\nThe Player and The Character\nThe first paradox of roleplay is that the player both directs and embodies his character. He directs it by indicating to the game leader all his actions; he embodies it by speaking through his mouth. In the first case, it is the character’s abilities and the result of the dice that indicate how things are done; in the second case, it is often the player’s own oratory abilities that count. But what if a shy or less articulate player wants to play a barrister capable of great oratory? What do you do when a player with a highly-developed oratory skills plays an illiterate bullhead who is unable to chat? Certainly not forbidding it; and you will probably find it very difficult to compensate for natural tendencies.\nNevertheless, there are several possibilities: the first is to listen first and foremost to the arguments put forward and not to the way they are said. Sometimes a simple, decisive word or phrase is enough to turn a discussion on its head; conversely, beware of tautology, bluster and obvious sophistry.\nThe second is to index the rolls (the character’s abilities) to the roleplay (the player’s words). Basically, if a player has glibness, take the difficulty of the rolls down a notch - a good player can eventually make up for his character’s crass incompetence, but that won’t do it. And don’t forget that a simple argument at the right moment sometimes counts for more than a very impressive one-man show.\n\n\nNature of social conflict\nWhere it gets tricky is that not all social situations are equal in terms of storytelling, and not all have the same stakes. The situations are extremely varied - from buying something on the black market to a ‘legal’ tussle in front of a yakuza oyabun, with the risk of having one’s little finger rolled in the sand, if not one’s head.\n\n\nGo fast, don’t play everything\nNot every situation is worth five minutes of show and tell that will involve one or two players and leave the rest idle. Bribing a guard to get into the museum just before closing time, convincing the intern at the hotel desk to show you the bad guy’s room, or getting hired as a bodyguard to watch over the backstage area of a mega-concert only requires a quick roll and sometimes no roll at all. These are actions that just indicate the direction the story is taking: you either get into the museum or not, you either get the location of the room or not, you either get hired or not. Of course, if you’re having fun, play the whole scene - sometimes that’s even the best thing to do (we told you it was sometimes paradoxical) - but frankly, don’t waste time.\n\n\nSmall talk\nAt the other end of the spectrum are all the exchanges that absolutely must be played in full to achieve their purpose: what information is actually being dropped by each party? What do we learn from a slip of the tongue or a clever innuendo? What do they reveal that they wanted to keep secret? These informal conversations have an unparalleled evocative power - the impression for the players that the world is truly alive, deep. Nevertheless, the game leader has to pay attention to several things: What does the person he is playing know and what does he not know during the conversation? What are his personal objectives, his fears, his desires, the means of compelling or seducing him? What is his real social power, his networks, his supports, his safeguards, his own means of pressure or seduction? What does he know about the characters and how does he view them? As dangerous adversaries? As mere transients who can take the blame for his own misdeeds? Likely allies whom it is good policy to support for the moment? During these conversations, feel free to put the rest of the world on stage around them - the servants coming and going, the children and family bustling about nearby, the staff taking notes and nodding knowingly, the little glances exchanged backstage, etc.\n\n\nBetween dog and wolf\nThere are still circumstances in which the conversation and the throw are equally important. Here you have to find the right balance. There are no precise rules like those of combat to manage social conflicts which must decide between two speakers - first and foremost because the player’s word counts and he will never be satisfied with a “And now it’s my turn to throw my argument in his face, 7 points of damage with the sarcastic smile bonus!\nSo how do you do it? You can manage everything in a Charisma roll, with a variable bonus or malus depending on the social or political position of each party, on the arguments put forward, on the weapons present, on the number of allies in the room, etc. You can make several rolls - the best of three or five rounds, for example. You can bring in outside referees - an influential corporatist, an ambitious gang leader, a well-connected cop - who listen to no one and push their own agenda. Use white and black tokens to count the arguments. Involve the crowd. Ask someone from outside the game table to sit in on the discussion and make a decision.\nThere is no single solution because there is no single social situation. Where combat always involves the use of weapons and well-defined physical tactical objectives, social conflict is highly subjective and therefore subject to all kinds of arbitration - so the game leader must always consider whether or not an extra is sensitive to arguments without stopping to consider whether or not he or she, as an individual, is sensitive to them.",

So there’s no need to go into detail about the number of seats available or the amount of cargo you can carry - everyone knows you don’t load a sofa into the back of a two-seat, truck-sized electric vehicle (although you can still use the roof if you have straps).\nThe second useful characteristic of a vehicle is its top speed - this determines how long it will take to get from one point to another, or whether it can escape a slower chaser. However, it is usually limited by traffic conditions, the nature of the roads or traffic regulations where they apply.\nIn the case of a chase, it is usually sufficient to compare the relative speeds of the vehicles - unless the chase is through the narrow streets of an old medieval city full of tourists: then size will certainly win out.",

Each hit or shot inflicts a wound. When the total is reached, the vehicle is out of service until it is repaired - or even destroyed.\n\nCollision: a vehicle that collides with an obstacle suffers a number of wounds corresponding to its current speed (1 for slow to 4 for ultra-fast). If the collision is frontal, add 1; if it is from the rear, subtract 1.\nArmour: A vehicle may have ‘natural’ armour. Armour indicates the type of firearms allowed to inflict injury on vehicles and the damage reduction offered to characters inside or behind the vehicle - it does not take into account the possibility of a vehicle exploding with its occupants: for this, there is Interflora (to order flowers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmor\nDamage reduction for passengers\nMinimum caliber\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nNone\n0\nAll firearms and other projectiles\nMotorbikes, scooters, convertibles\n\n\nSlight\n1d6\nAll firearms\nCivilian vehicles\n\n\nMedium\n2d6\nAssault rifles as a minimum\nSecurity or heavy civilian vehicles\n\n\nHeavy\n3d6\nHeavy guns, rockets and missiles\nMilitary vehicles\n\n\n\n\nPhysical defence: a vehicle has a physical defence of 7 when stationary and 11 when moving.

It’s not necessarily the biggest or most powerful organisation, but it’s clearly the one that sets the pace of events. It’s almost always an organisation with a high profile and respectability.\nThe Other is ambivalent: it is both the big bad of the story and an ally of the characters. He has his fingers in every jam jar around here, but not always for the wrong reasons. His motivations are complex and we can even agree with his arguments without denying his soul.\nThe Other is multiple: there is not just one person at its head, but many factions and groups with divergent and personal interests who agree on only one thing: The Other must survive all storms, whatever the means used.\nThe Other is at the heart of events: almost every story you tell will have some connection, however remote, with The Other. Whether it’s something that concerns him directly or whether it concerns a distant cousin of a junior executive in the legal department on the tenth floor.

That’s what mattered, that’s what you had to have. Money, power, control. And you had to have as much of it as you could.\n—R.J. Ellory, Bad Star\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName the Other\nFind a snappy name that is easy to pronounce and remember - an acronym perhaps, or a name with many allegorical meanings. The important thing is that you use this one name from now on to refer to The Other. The Other does not exist; The Other is just a facility, a code name for this section of the book. At your table, The Other must become the centre of attention.\n\n\nDescribe the Other\nHere are a few different tables to help you picture The Other.\n\n\n\n1D6\nNATURE OF THE OTHER\n\n\n\n\n1\nA local corporation\n\n\n2\nAn orbital corporation\n\n\n3\nAn NGO\n\n\n4\nA criminal organisation\n\n\n5\nA governmental organisation\n\n\n6\nA secret society or cult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nTHE OTHER’S FACADE\n\n\n\n\n1\nFriendly and sympathetic\n\n\n2\nCharitable and benevolent\n\n\n3\nDiscreet and cold\n\n\n4\nMysterious\n\n\n5\nRespectable and serious\n\n\n6\nScandalous and media-friendly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nTHE OTHER’S SECRET MEANS\n\n\n\n\n1\nMoney, lots of it\n\n\n2\nFast and efficient henchmen\n\n\n3\nEffective political and judicial influence\n\n\n4\nUnprecedented and secret technological means\n\n\n5\nAccurate and comprehensive intelligence\n\n\n6\nUnshakeable public image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nWEAKNESSES OF THE OTHER\n\n\n\n\n1\nA lot of indecision and delay\n\n\n2\nToo much infighting\n\n\n3\nAmbitions without the means\n\n\n4\nCruelty, baby, cruelty\n\n\n5\nVery poor public image\n\n\n6\nToo much self-confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nTHE OTHER’S REAL GOALS\n\n\n\n\n1\nCONTROL: The Other wants power in one (or all) areas. It is about control and mastery. This can easily turn into fascism when The Other also wants to ‘create’ the conditions for an ideal society on its terms.\n\n\n2\nCONVEY: The Other covets something. It may be power or wealth, or something simpler like an absolute monopoly on a particular technology. All his manoeuvres consist of creating the conditions for his success by eliminating competitors or by seeking the object of desire.\n\n\n3\nCREATION: The Other has a great idea and wants to implement it, even if people don’t agree. It may be something physical (developing innovative energy systems that will put all oil workers out of work, creating a race of super soldiers) or something more conceptual (establishing perfect security in a fully Christianised world). Generally, it’s not without trial, error and escaped laboratory creatures.\n\n\n4\nDESTRUCTION: The ultimate goal of The Other is to destroy something - the social order, enemies, an ethnic group, a political faction, trade unionists, polluters, orbiters, earthlings, etc. - and to make it a reality. The Other has embarked on a complex and far-reaching plan, spanning several years or decades, to ensure the success of the enterprise.\n\n\n5\nEXPANSION: The Other wants to expand or extend its influence throughout a community, city or region. This can be about gaining market share or putting key people in important positions. This is the crude application of the concept: Grow or Lose.\n\n\n6\nPROTECTION: The Other wants to protect something or someone. This may be to protect a community from a threat, to protect the threat itself, to defend against outsiders, to protect a way of life or customs. Usually, this is not without cruel decisions and extreme actions.\n\n\n\nThe Other may react in very different ways to perceived threats. Some reactions are brutal, others subtle. The following table gives you some examples of threats and possible reactions:\n\n\n\nIN CASE OF…\n1D26\nTHE REACTION IS…\n\n\n\n\nAttack\n1.1\nHand over to the authorities\n\n\nDeparture or resignation\n1.2\nCorrupt\n\n\nDisappearance\n1.3\nDestroy credibility\n\n\nElimination\n1.4\nEliminate\n\n\nEspionage\n1.5\nCover up\n\n\nExtraction\n1.6\nIntercept\n\n\nLeakage\n2.1\nLeave it alone or ignore\n\n\nIntrusion\n2.2\nManipulating opinion\n\n\nThreats\n2.3\nThreatening\n\n\nPublic disclosure\n2.4\nEntrapment\n\n\nSurveillance\n2.5\nBringing to court\n\n\nTheft\n2.6\nSurveillance\n\n\n\n\n\nDivide and Conquer\nYou are left to divide The Other into factions that support, fight or ignore each other. Some factions are well known; others operate in the shadows. Some are well-resourced, with complex networks; others have only a few highly motivated people.\nMost of the time, you will need at least three factions within The Other:\n\nAn old, entrenched, brutal but sleepy ruling faction, which personifies the traditional broad directions of The Other. The old faction is conservative, powerful, stable, and well-organised, though no longer as vigilant. The goals of the members of this faction are often the same as those of The Other, to which can be added, in many cases, a thirst for power and a bit of welcome greed. The old faction is always very careful about its reputation and the reputation of The Other; it wants to keep up appearances and if it can make clear and quick decisions, it will not easily engage in actions that are too… messy, preferring to use subtle and legal means of coercion to achieve its ends: it is easier to ruin someone or to take away the slightest reason to live than to kill them directly.\nA younger faction, extremely dynamic, really bad, for whom the end justifies the means (all means). This faction has teeth that scratch the floor and wants the old faction’s place, unless it is to take advantage of The Other’s means to achieve completely different goals. This faction is a parasite, a tumour, but it is run by people who are smart enough not to let it show. On the other hand, it’s not a problem for them to get their hands dirty - a large part of their resources are mobilised by the need to clean up after themselves, including eliminating compromised agents and assets, but at least they achieve their goals with some speed.\nAnd an even younger faction, poorly settled, ill at ease with itself, which may help the characters if it realises that the other factions are evil, or which will fight them ferociously, out of sheer solidarity, if they alienate its goodwill through outright aggression. This faction is the most ambivalent of all; it is certainly idealistic, in its own way, and does not conceive of the use of extreme means. But there is nothing to say that it will not become radicalised if given no choice. And then she could become the most dangerous thing in Chrome City.\n\nIf The Other is some kind of anonymous, awesome monolith, it’s important that the factions are led by real people (or possibly akhashic spirits, of course). Write down names; establish simple relational networks between faction members - who likes whom and why? Who hates whom and why? Who is under influence? Who owes favours? Who will betray? Who sleeps with whom? Who has skeletons in their wardrobe, debts, dark secrets?\nMake general plans for each faction, short and medium term goals according to their motivations.\n\n\n\n1D6\nFACTION MOTIVATIONS\n\n\n\n\n1\nGreed\n\n\n2\nLust\n\n\n3\nHatred\n\n\n4\nPower\n\n\n5\nVision\n\n\n6\nRevenge",

    "text": "Managing cycles\n\nThere is a time for everything under the heavens: a time to be silent and a time to speak; a time to love and a time to hate; a time for war and a time for peace.\n—Qoheleth 3:1\n\nFor the game leader, managing the cycles is like playing 1, 2, 3, Sun!\nAs long as the characters are acting, within a cycle, the various factions and the main figures do not move. As soon as the players announce a cycle change, they rush to their objectives and activate their means of action. What does this mean in practice?\n\nWhen a cycle begins, the factions are in a defined initial position. Their agents are engaged here or there (although some may be available); their attention is focused on specific issues; they act according to their needs.\nAs the cycle progresses, the factions can react if they are directly attacked by characters or events, but they do not have the ability to redistribute their resources or change their general conformation - the extras are, in a sense, ‘frozen’ in space. If the characters learn that a particular extra is in a particular place, he or she will be there for the rest of the cycle. “This does not mean that they do not move, but that they are assigned to tasks or missions and will only leave if there are emergencies that affect them directly. An agent may be investigating a gang or trying to exfiltrate a scientist from another corpo: he will move and act within the scope of his mission, but will not”move” unless the characters interfere.\nOn the other hand, when the cycle changes, the factions can change everything, reorganise everything. The extras can eventually move, recall forces, sound alarms, beg on the characters, take action against their loved ones, etc. In short, there is a good chance that at the beginning of the next cycle, the characters’ information will no longer be completely up to date. The leader of a faction was in his country house where the characters could come and kidnap him? He either took his helicopter away or increased his security by hiring threatening techmercs.\nOf course, don’t change everything all the time, because you can. The factions have very elaborate plans and only change their protocols if the characters get their attention. Nevertheless, be consistent, logical and ruthless, brutal if you must or can be. Changing the cycle has enormous benefits for the characters, but the players should feel the pinch every time!\n\nFinally, remember that factions have goals and if given time, will achieve them. You can assume, for example, that it will take two, three, five cycles for a faction to fully achieve one of its goals if the characters do nothing to stop it. The consequences will simply be front page news at the beginning of the next cycle…",

You play as guys who will do anything to eat and burn. You like money and adrenaline, in any order you like. You show off for the gallery under the guise of rebellious misfits, but in reality, you’re waiting for the big score that will buy you a deserted island in the Pacific or a way to get back at someone. Draw or choose a motivation for each character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nTECHMERC MOTIVATION\n\n\n\n\n1\nTo help a family member who is in big trouble\n\n\n2\nChange the world or change the world\n\n\n3\nMake a big score to pay off all your debts and finally see the sun\n\n\n4\nFind a way to get your kid back from being stolen by dirty corpos\n\n\n5\nBe loyal to the mentor who taught you and your family everything who’s been protecting you all your life\n\n\n6\nGet revenge for a dirty trick that left you stranded once upon a time\n\n\n\nWith techmercs, you can have one adventure after another without bothering too much with The Other at first. Just make him appear gradually and establish a race to see who will achieve their goals first: the characters or The Other?\nThe adventures almost always have a similar structure: the Client meets the characters, gives them a mission and promises them payment. The mission is more complicated than it seems; objectives and secondary factions collide and compete; there is betrayal or misinformation; the bad guys need scapegoats. If the characters make it out alive - they know they’re just pawns in the corporate wars - they still have to pay for it and suffer the retribution of those who lost.\nOf course, as a campaign progresses, the characters will have more resources, political support, connections, information to use. And more enemies and more problems with the authorities. And they will be identified and locked out by The Other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nWHO IS THE CLIENT?\n\n\n\n\n1\nAn elderly corporatist executive, his eyes burnt out by all he has already seen and done.\n\n\n2\nA young guy with big teeth, full of accelerants accelerators, excited as a flea and rather expansive.\n\n\n3\nA sharp and jovial O.G. with a sharp mind as his body blades.\n\n\n4\nA retired former techmerc, a bit off at times, but still on the ball.\n\n\n5\nA pretty, discreet and cold young woman who keeps the characters at a distance and does not respond to any of their their direct requests.\n\n\n6\nA presence on the matrix - no doubt an akashic spirit, but who can really know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nWHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE CLIENT?\n\n\n\n\n1\nIt is a simple intermediary, a transmission belt. Nothing personal, one way or the other.\n\n\n2\nCalm and resigned to the darkness of his job, he organises things as best he can and puts oil in the wheels so that everyone gets through.\n\n\n3\nHe is deadly serious when it comes to business. We’re not here to fraternise, but the job must be done at all costs and he’s always available. Just remember that he doesn’t like excuses.\n\n\n4\nThe Client always has advice to give, checks on the progress of operations every five minutes, sometimes intervenes in the field without being asked. Who said “Pain in the ass”?\n\n\n5\nThe Client is warm, patient and understanding. Always.\n\n\n6\nThe Client is passive-aggressive and never gives satisfaction. He always has something to reproach the characters with and will recriminate at the slightest request.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nWHAT IS THE CLIENT’S POSITION?\n\n\n\n\n1\nHe is a front man for a secret power.\n\n\n2\nHe is an undercover government agent.\n\n\n3\nHe is another techmerc who subcontracts some of his missions.\n\n\n4\nHe is an employee of the Other.\n\n\n5\nHe is a freelancer who works for himself and has a lot of money.\n\n\n6\nHe is a freelance intermediary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nWHAT IS THE CLIENT’S MOTIVATION?\n\n\n\n\n1\nIt’s a job like any other. Tomorrow, the Client may be assigned to the marketing department of his company.\n\n\n2\nThere’s always stuff to skim - money, information, stuff to sell. There’s no reason not to make a little extra on the backs of the characters.\n\n\n3\nThe Client has a complicated personal history, a score to settle or an intimate investigation to unravel. And every assignment he gives has a little extra to it that only concerns him.\n\n\n4\nThe Client would have liked to become a techmerc. But he has a degree and he doesn’t like violence, so he might as well settle for a more comfortable and better-paid position. But still, he would have liked to be a techmerc too…\n\n\n5\nThe Client is, secretly or not, connected to the characters and tries to protect or guide them.\n\n\n6\nSomeone is putting pressure on the Client with convincing arguments - intimidation, vital resources, information, blackmail…\n\n\n\nAt the end of a job for the Client, you may wish to choose or draw an item from the next table - without any obligation. Something goes wrong and the characters may be surprised by the outcome of their mission…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nTHE END OF A MISSION\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe operation receives full media coverage (thanks Panopticom!).\n\n\n2\nThe operation has not gone unnoticed and the Other has all the details in hand.\n\n\n3\nThe target of the contract takes revenge on the characters or their or their relatives, unless they ask for a a ‘voluntary’ service to wipe the slate clean.\n\n\n4\nThe Client does not like to leave a trail of operations and a team is assigned to eliminate the characters.\n\n\n5\nThe Client is not who he seems and in the end, he screws everyone over.\n\n\n6\nYou don’t get the full amount promised, if you only get paid.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporates\n\nAbove the state and behind the facades of apparent power, in the maze of multiple departments, underlying all shifts of authority and in the chaos of inefficiency, lies the core of power in the country: the hyper-efficient and hyper-competent secret police.\n—Hannah Arendt\n\nWell, it’s not complicated: you work for The Other, in one of its security services no doubt, doing intelligence or counter-intelligence, or research why not.\nThis mode of play is perhaps a little more difficult to set up for the game leader: he does not benefit from a wide variety of hooks for adventures and the characters can legitimately have access to important means and discreet but effective support. Moreover, he has to put The Other into action very quickly and involve the various factions involved: the rumours of corridors, office intrigues and internal affairs take up a lot of game time and you have to improvise on a complex social canvas.\nNevertheless, the characters have clear and identifiable objectives: to protect the employer’s assets and to be accountable. And they are immediately involved in the secrets of The Other.\nAnother advantage is that the characters’ mission is simply to bring the factions’ plans to fruition - you only have to write one scenario!\nIn the meantime, between or during missions, add a little spice to the characters’ hard working lives.\n\n\n\n1D36\nINTERNAL LIFE OR A FEW MINUTES AT THE COFFEE MACHINE\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nChange of management\n\n\n1.2\nCatfight\n\n\n1.3\nJokes that go wrong\n\n\n1.4\nColleagues who are a bit too free\n\n\n1.5\nWork all over the place\n\n\n1.6\nJealousy drama\n\n\n2.1\nNervous exhaustion\n\n\n2.2\nPolitical wrangling\n\n\n2.3\nWaste and mismanagement\n\n\n2.4\nMoral harassment\n\n\n2.5\nThe age of individual evaluations\n\n\n2.6\nShortage of drawing pins and paper clips\n\n\n3.1\nOffice romance\n\n\n3.2\nBitch-talk night\n\n\n3.3\nA crow leaves messages on the intranet\n\n\n3.4\nA bet in progress\n\n\n3.5\nA bit too much water at the farewell party\n\n\n3.6\nA medical alert\n\n\n\n\n\nPanopticom\n\nIt’s not a crime, not a trick, not a dirty trick, not a swindle, not a vice that does not endure without the secrecy that surrounds it. Expose these facts in the open, describe them, attack them, ridicule them in the press and sooner or later public opinion will drive them out. Publicity may not be the only thing necessary but it is one thing without which all other efforts will be in vain.\n—Joseph Pulitzer\n\nPanopticom is an investigative feature programme. It broadcasts a new issue every few weeks, featuring one or more stories provided by Panopticom cells.\nThe programme takes its name from the theories of panoptic architecture: “the surveillance of all by all”. For that is the purpose of its existence: to monitor and denounce from within the walls, in an active position and not as mere witnesses falsely hiding behind the corrupt status of journalist.\nPanopticom cells are independent of each other, inserted into society. Anyone can join - there is no press card, no registration, no official existence. Those who make up a cell are truth resisters and act as such, in the shadows, spying, monitoring, exposing, tracking down weaknesses.\nA few cells wallow in sensationalism, in gonzo people; but most deal with hot topics, social problems, corruption, health scandals, political prevarications, small arrangements between the powerful that have an impact on the whole of society. They highlight the individual responsibilities in all the decisions that affect us all: no more hiding behind the secrets of deliberations or supposed orders from the hierarchy. No more buying, cheating, corrupting those who report. No more leverage - money, prestige, position, reputation, vanity. Only anonymous truth.\nPanopticom’s hope is to create a virtuous society because everyone will take responsibility with full knowledge of the facts. Is this fascism? No. It’s about transforming man in depth. Is it humanism? It is forcing civilisation to progress despite the conservative brakes and privileges that are defended tooth and nail.\nRegularly, at the passage of cycles, when they are ready, the Panopticom cells return their reports. These are accepted or not by the programme’s anonymous producers according to objective criteria, insofar as they are reliable. A report that is too weak, poorly researched or incomplete is likely to be rejected.\nIf the information is inaccurate or untrue, the public and the mass media will pick up on this after the broadcast - and the reputation of the unit will suffer terribly. A good reputation increases the likelihood that the cell’s stories will be accepted, even with lower standards; a bad reputation allows mistrust to set in, even when all the standards are met. A cell with a destroyed reputation will have the greatest difficulty in continuing to provide reports: truthfulness, evidence and verification are the main concerns of most cells.\nEspecially since an anonymous crowdfunding system allows the cells with the best reputations to receive larger budgets the more popular and followed their reports are.\nEach story that is accepted and delivered earns 5¥ and an additional 100 XP per character.\n\nCriteria\nThe ten criteria are both a roadmap for the characters - to help them organise and structure their investigations and research - and quantifiable objectives. When a report is handed in, the leader rolls 2d6. If the result is higher than the number of criteria met, the story is rejected - it can be resubmitted later if at least one other criterion has been met. The 2d6 roll is modified by the reputation of the cell.\nPlayers are given several criteria sheets and fill them in as they go along - one for each case in progress. This serves as a note sheet for information, a status bar for the investigation, and a tracking sheet so they always know what to do. A story is only acceptable if the sheet is carefully filled in (and legible).\n\nThe issue, the angle of approach: the characters discuss why and how they take on a story and note their initial intentions, a priori, and then, when the story starts to take shape, the way they want to treat it in the report.\nThe basic facts: who what where when how why. This is the initial framework for getting as much factual information as possible.\nCauses and consequences: the events leading up to the case and its discovery and the impact the case has on the people involved.\nThe deeper facts: what lies behind or beyond; possible ramifications, implications at other levels.\nThe impact in society: how the story resonates in the city, the practical implications of the story before and after it is revealed; the opinion of the circles of power (political, economic, religious, etc.)\nEvidence: what can be brought forward as solid evidence to support the story - this would allow the case to go to court and be heard in summary proceedings.\nPictures: to make a good and interesting story to follow on the matrix.\nConfrontation: to confront the actors and perpetrators, to get their opinion on the story and the facts presented. This step is very important to get last minute information or insights.\nThe involvement of The Other: The Other is always involved. Always. You just have to find the links, direct or indirect.\nEthics: this criterion is ticked, or not, by the leader. It is the conscience of the characters - did they do their job sincerely and professionally? Did they hide facts or lie? Did they leave out things that should be brought to people’s attention? It’s really a Jiminy Cricket thing. No value or moral judgement, just questioning the path taken from the characters’ point of view. They may have been misled and therefore give false information - and yet tick this criterion because they have done their best.\n\n\n\nReputation\nThe cells that work for Panopticom have a good or bad reputation, both from the public and from the press campaigns of those involved. This is a tricky thing for the game leader to manage, but very important:\n\nOn the one hand, he has to judge objectively whether the story holds up or not, whether the characters have missed information that will be revealed later and may destroy or support their case.\nOn the other hand, he has to manage the public and media returns of the revelations. Do people follow or not? Do the people involved defend themselves well or not?\n\nThese two elements should allow you to vary the reputation of the cell after each broadcast (or even later). Each report can vary the reputation by 1 point up or down, with extremes from -3 to +3.\nApply reputation to the 2d6 roll for acceptance of the story, but also to the ¥ the characters receive.",

    "text": "Conducting an investigation\n\n“Woe! He’s building a city on blood! He founds a city on crime!”\n—Habakkuk 2, 12\n\nAn investigation is a puzzle where the leader knows the answer(s) and the players try to guess the solution by asking questions.\nIt is a complicated exercise, both for the game leader and for the players. The players like puzzles. Most of the time they like to play with their brains and crack seemingly unsolvable problems, especially when they want to prove to you that they are much smarter than you (the fools!). But, if they are not stupid, remember that they are groping their way through the fog and darkness. What may seem perfectly logical and coherent to you, because you know the ins and outs, may not make sense to them because they lack the elements to make connections between different clues.\nThe leader must be consistent and logical in his answers; he must not leave anything out, and yet he cannot rely on the players to follow exactly the path he has imagined in his mind: sometimes they have incredible insights that make them skip several steps at once; other times they are blind and deaf and bang their heads against walls for hours.\nSo it’s always a balancing act: keeping the mystery alive and not boring the players, making them think without making the problem unsolvable…\nHere are a few tips and tools to stage a good investigation that satisfies everyone, a whudonit that will not frustrate anyone and that will have as much rhythm as a good TV series.\nFirst of all, remember that the game leader has two main missions, which at first glance seem contradictory and yet must absolutely complement each other:\n\nThe players must be forced to rack their brains so that there is challenge and difficulty.\nThe players must have fun and frustration must never outweigh the pleasure.\n\n\nQuestions and answers\nAn investigation is about finding information to make a decision: Who committed this crime? Where are the secret laboratories of the corporation? Who is behind the chain of events that is shaking the city and why?\nGenerally, this information is not particularly secret or hidden and it just takes time: finding building plans, accessing financial information, building a biographical file on someone from their presence on the matrix… A simple Intelligence roll to solve a document search can be enough. The difficulty, in reality, is knowing where to look and asking the right questions.\nWhen the characters have to deal with a crime, a conspiracy or secret corporate manoeuvres, things get more complicated, but basically, it’s always the same process:\n\nThe characters need information.\nThey take the necessary actions to obtain that information.\nThey use this information to make a decision: to seek new information or to act on the information they have already accumulated.\n\nSometimes the search is very specific - the characters have a name, for example, and look for anything related to it. Other times the search is more open-ended: examining a crime scene, going through papers without knowing what they might find, interviewing people in the hope of getting a description.\nThe rule for the game leader is very simple: when the players ask a question, you have to give them an answer!\nThe players are not there to wander around in the dark, blind, for hours. A role-playing game is not real life, where investigators can run into walls for months or years, or even never find the culprit of heinous crimes. Here, as in a TV series, the investigation has to be completed in a relatively short time and therefore every question must be answered.\nSometimes it can be a simple “You’re burning up” or “You’re freezing your butt off” - in an appropriate form: “You’ve been through the documents and found nothing. They really don’t seem to be related to your case.\nThe rest of the time, they are pieces of the puzzle that should force the characters to undertake new research or new actions.\n\n\nCritical path\nThere are two types of information:\n\nInformation that is strictly necessary to continue the investigation. This information must always be given, at some point, if the players ask the right questions - and sometimes, even if they don’t do the right things: all it takes is for a witness to come to them spontaneously!\nBonus information, which provides additional insight or leads to interesting secondary leads. This bonus information can sometimes speed up an investigation by giving the characters enough momentum to skip several steps or link the pieces of the puzzle together more easily. They can only be unearthed if the players ask specific questions or if their characters make particularly good skill rolls. Eventually, they may come later in the investigation, in the form of pieces needed to move forward: for example, crime scene findings that speed up the first few hours of the investigation, but which should arrive the next day anyway when all the lab work has been done.\n\nThis is where the game leader’s job is particularly tricky: he or she has to determine which clues and information are available and how they lead to the solution. You should be very wary of things that are too constructed and too written down.\nTrust yourself: you know the end of the investigation, where it should end up. So you must be able, at any moment and without difficulty, to trace a path between this end and the stage where the characters are. Improvisation in an investigation is never difficult. Let yourself be carried along by the plot itself, since you don’t need to bounce off the players’ actions to change the world, but only expose to them, snippet by snippet, in order or disorder, all the aspects of a story already written. This is the easiest thing to do in improvisation.\n\nWhat remains to be discovered?\nWhat are the obstacles that remain before we get to the end of the story?\nWhat do the characters need to move forward?\nHow do the target(s) of the investigation protect or hide themselves?\nWhat actions do they take that may leave new clues (according to the Locard principle)?\n\nAll of these questions translate into various pieces of information that you should dispense gradually. What you must absolutely avoid is determining in advance that such and such a clue is in the hands of such and such a person, member of such and such a gang in such and such a neighbourhood. If the characters never set foot in the area, they will never have the information. On the other hand, you can decide that only gangsters or criminals can give this information: use the characters’ relations and contacts; wait for them to go to someone who fits your needs or, at worst, someone who tells them that they should go to gangsters (and gives them a contact, why not).\nThere are two things that should guide the way you slip information in:\n\nThe coherence of your story - just link directly to the circumstances of the crime, its chronological development, the personalities or means of the bad guys.\nThe opportunities the players give you - answer their questions, always.\n\n\n\nWhat’s the point?\nWhy do you need to make your investigators’ lives easier and give them answers? Simple: the investigation itself is not the most important part of the story. What really matters is what the characters do with it at the end.\nThey have information; they have all the pieces of the puzzle. They still have to put them together in the right order and without misunderstandings, and most importantly, they now have to act!\nAnd if you’ve done your job well, it won’t be easy for them: the culprit may have excellent reasons and his victims were bastards; the culprit is untouchable, protected by powerful supporters; if it’s possible to know he’s guilty, it’s impossible to prove it; nobody believes the characters or the story interests anyone; someone is confiscating all the work of the characters and making the evidence, the victims and the culprits disappear…\nThe important thing is that the characters have something to do with the results of their investigation, that they are forced to make choices or take action based on this information.\n\n\n\n1D36\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nOfficial records\n\n\n1.2\nPersonal files\n\n\n1.3\nMedical records\n\n\n1.4\nRelatives\n\n\n1.5\nRelationships or associates of the target\n\n\n1.6\nThe police\n\n\n2.1\nFinancial analyst\n\n\n2.2\nNewspaper article\n\n\n2.3\nInterested client\n\n\n2.4\nConfidential informant\n\n\n2.5\nA forensic laboratory\n\n\n2.6\nA cooperative witness\n\n\n3.1\nA reluctant witness\n\n\n3.2\nAn anonymous tip\n\n\n3.3\nA press conference\n\n\n3.4\nA hunch\n\n\n3.5\nA search on the matrix\n\n\n3.6\nA rumour in the street\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D26\nATTITUDES OF WITNESSES\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nUnclear, uncertain, hesitant\n\n\n1.2\nCategorical, confident\n\n\n1.3\nToo many irrelevant details\n\n\n1.4\nEvasive, reluctant, obstinate, distrustful\n\n\n1.5\nUnfriendly, aggressive, uncooperative\n\n\n1.6\nInquisitive, curious, answers questions\n\n\n2.1\nHides something, conceals, lies\n\n\n2.2\nWants something out of it, greedy, interested\n\n\n2.3\nAlready contacted by others, threatened, coerced\n\n\n2.4\nInventive, mythomaniac, manipulative\n\n\n2.5\nScared, won’t say anything, doesn’t want to talk\n\n\n2.6\nIn a hurry, late, not now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D36\nTYPE OF INFORMATION\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nDNA fingerprints\n\n\n1.2\nComputer files\n\n\n1.3\nBundles of paper\n\n\n1.4\nChemicals\n\n\n1.5\nFootprints or tyre tracks\n\n\n1.6\nBlood\n\n\n2.1\nA serial number\n\n\n2.2\nAn object\n\n\n2.3\nAn appointment\n\n\n2.4\nA network or known links\n\n\n2.5\nAn address in the matrix\n\n\n2.6\nA physical address\n\n\n3.1\nA weapon\n\n\n3.2\nA chronology\n\n\n3.3\nA physical description\n\n\n3.4\nAncient history\n\n\n3.5\nReal-time location\n\n\n3.6\nA note on the back of a matchbox",

    "text": "A note on the back of a matchbox\n\nI was trying to work out exactly how, when and where I should act and, most importantly, what I was going to do if it went wrong. Once the target had been chosen, the outline of a kidnapping is almost always the same. One, reconnaissance; two, abduction; three, detention; four, negotiations; five, payment of ransom; and finally, release - although sometimes this does not happen. My job was to prepare and execute the first three steps; the rest was not my concern.\n—Andy McNab, Operation Firewall\n\nBefore you go on an intrusion mission, you may want to prepare a plan. Let’s be clear: it’s up to the characters to make the plan, not the players. The players are not in the field, and it’s well known that operational agents always get screwed when it’s the analysts who do the planning.\nBefore a mission, each character can spend ¥2 to regain a number of connection points equal to the rank of the characteristic of his choice. This corresponds to how well he prepares: Strength or Constitution to do some heavy lifting like modifying a vehicle or arranging for destructive equipment, Dexterity or Intelligence to retrieve data or fiddle with electronics, Wisdom or Charisma to get information from the right people.\nYou don’t need to list exactly what you prepare or get. The character is considered to be doing the right thing in their chosen field.\nYou can use these connection points (and the rest of your stash) in the usual way - to hack the matrix or activate relationships - but in the context of a specific intrusion or mission, you can also spend them on inventing ways to get out of trouble when things start going wrong. Every time the leader throws up an obstacle, an unpleasant surprise, a twist, you can pretend that you had planned it. Spend connection points (possibly pooling them) and explain how you are too strong: the security guard was bribed to let you through; you fingerprinted the executive to turn on his secure office console; you have a key to a back staircase allowing you to leave the floor while avoiding the SWAT team, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnection points\nEffects\n\n\n\n\n1\nRemove a minor obstacle that you could obviously pass easily, but which would then take you a few minutes when you only have a few seconds.\n\n\n3\nEscape a major hazard or remove an embarrassing obstacle that you could not get past if you had not provided the equipment, skills or information.\n\n\n5+\nClearing a major obstacle or escaping immediate and deadly danger, by absolutely cheating the odds and virtually changing the leader’s descriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple uses of connection points\n\n\n\nWhen you play the basic game, connection points are only used for one thing: hacking and manipulating the live matrix. Intermediaries have a special rule for summoning connections and asking them for services. Then, swordsmen (in particular) learn that they can spend connection points to make certain special ammunition available. And finally, these connection points are also used to manipulate the scenes. This gets seriously complicated. In reality, connection points are a “mystical” resource - the equivalent of magic points in Pocket Dragon. They indicate how you can cheat the rules to get special effects, to act like the heroes in the movies (they have the writers on their side) and get out of the worst situations with a spin. Notice how the actors always have a pool of water under their feet when they accidentally go out the window? But it’s a resource you have to manage - sure, it replenishes itself every day and you can even spend luck points to recharge it during the adventure, but if the game’s leader gets a bit carried away with his adventures, you’ll soon run out.",

    "text": "Intrusions\n\nSo, shovel in one hand, gun in the other, we leap from hole to hole, ready to pounce again when our breath has returned and our hearts have calmed down a bit. The heavy artillery has set up one hell of a barrage. From the forest huge white flames emerge and the trees are falling as if under a gigantic scythe. We see the Russians cowering behind their dead corpses, since a corpse is as effective a protection as a sandbag; as for sensitivity, there is no room for it at the front. Don’t blame the unfortunate soldiers, but the criminals who provoke wars!\n—Sven Hassel, I saw them die\n\nThere are times when you need to speed things up and structure the elements of your adventure a little better: for example, when you have to break into an archaeology to extract someone and implant a virus in their neurotronic systems, or when you have to traverse a district of the anarzone in the middle of a civil war while planting spy nanodrones and looting a gang’s accelerator supply.\nThere are three ways to do this:\n\nYou plan in advance all the game elements you want to place and recite your lesson as rigorously as possible.\nThe players roll one or two times and it’s hit or miss.\nYou use the intrusion rules presented here.\n\nAn intrusion is the generic name given to a mission with one or more specific, pre-planned tactical objectives - usually one to three. The intrusion is completed when all objectives have been met.\nThe players determine the number of objectives to be completed and the order in which they are completed. The first objective earns 5 XP per character; the second earns 10 XP, the third 15 and so on. It is not possible to take a rest while there are still objectives to complete, unless you give up and the mission is interrupted.\nThe game leader has a little preparation to do before launching his players into intrusion. Don’t worry, it’s not much.\nFill out a small table for each objective to be accomplished. The table usually has 6 items numbered from 1 to 6 (but if you have the right stuff on hand, you can vary the die used from d4 to d10 to represent the difficulty or length of the operation). The 1 is always “goal achieved” (at least, the characters are able to do what they need to do now to achieve it). For the other elements, you can pick and choose from the following suggestions according to your needs and desires. Try to put the things you consider most dangerous at the top of the die and the things that are more favourable to the characters at the bottom of the table. By choosing the items on each table, the leader can really guide the moods he wants to set for events, even if he doesn’t ultimately decide exactly what they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nEXAMPLE OF HOW DANGEROUS THE EVENTS ARE\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe characters achieve their objective\n\n\n2\nThe adventure is annoying and wastes the characters’ time characters, but does not put the mission back into play.\n\n\n3\nThe incident is a real puzzle, difficult to solve, but the characters have some time.\n\n\n4\nThings suddenly speed up. It’s not deadly, but it is explosive.\n\n\n5\nIt’s a pretty dangerous ride, but the characters have a few moments’ notice.\n\n\n6\nThe situation is extremely dangerous and things jump out at the characters without them having had time to prepare.\n\n\n\nOPPOSITION\n\nAt gunpoint\nWatch out! Behind you!\nContact! Contact!\nUnexpected face to face\nThere are too many of them!\nAlarms are sounding…\nMuted threat approaching…\nChanging of the guard\nA new competitor\n\nOBSTACLE\n\nWhere is the exit again?\nThe timing couldn’t be worse!\nSentinels keeping watch\nEsclandre!\nHead against the wall…\nGlass wall…\nForceful passage\nToo many choices\nA diversion that is much too long…\n\nDANGER\n\nTake cover!!!\nIt’s a trap!\nIt’ll blow up in your face!\nSuspicious smells\nShouldn’t you have turned left?\nUp to your neck!\nThe noose is tightening…\nPoint of no return\nChain reaction!\n\nSURPRISE\n\nMuch ado about nothing!\nGood information, bad interpretation…\nUnfortunate coincidences\nAmbush!\nI didn’t see it coming…\nThe fear of your life!\nThe dust settles…\nStunned and shaken\nBetrayal!\n\nMEETING\n\nAngel or demon?\nBlackmail and pressure\nDefection!\nAttentive and discreet people\nDiversion\nI’ve got just what you need\nMisunderstanding and misunderstanding\nA really weird guy\nSmall staff\n\nRECEPTION\n\nIt can’t hurt…\nWhere is everyone?\nNobody…\nLittle help?\nStockpile of materials\nCare and repair\nA teasing smile\nA comfortable cache\nInformation perhaps?\n\nMYSTERY\n\nHow does this thing work?\nIn the dark suddenly!\nStrange and disturbing noises…\nNon-Euclidean geometry\nUncertain identification\nThe lens has disappeared!\nTractations…\nA detail you all missed…\nA moment of hesitation…\n\nCATASTROPHE\n\nFatal blow!\nSudden disappearance\nCollateral damage\nCheckmate!\nAnd it’s an explosion!\nFlee, you fools!\nFire in the belly\nPoisoning\nWe are going to be separated!\n\nNow it’s up to the players. Each player in turn draws a die. Write down the title of the story on a post-it note. It’s up to him to invent an adventure, a twist, an obstacle, a threat, a danger. He takes the lead, lays the foundations of the situation, imagines some interesting elements and then hands over control to you when, naturally, you ask the question “What are you doing?”\nThen play the scene as normal, integrate the proposed elements into the narrative and the rest of the story, bounce around, add your own ingredients and let the players work it out - remember they still have a few plan points to spend just in case (at least if they’ve been careful to prepare).\nWhen the players get the long-awaited 1, the objective is revealed, it is within reach. Don’t forget to play the scene: they still have to win the thing.\nWhen the last objective is reached, you can play a final episode if the extraction is not too complicated or plan a final scene - on 1, the characters are finally safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the characters find relevant information, quick shortcuts or have dazzling intuitions. In this case, reduce the dice (e.g. roll 1d3 instead of 1d6) while the advantage remains - this helps to achieve the objective more quickly. Similarly, you may or may not feel that the same number cannot be rolled twice; conversely, you can have fun, if the players land on the same number, giving them a different title the second time around…\n\n\n\n\nAn example\nThe characters must infiltrate a corporate marina, find a specific yacht, plant clues that compromise a specific frame and copy the memories of the onboard computer. That’s two objectives: 1. enter the marina and find the yacht; 2. plant the clues and access the computer. Of course, there are guards everywhere, security systems and the yacht is really big (and busy).\nThe leader should therefore prepare two small adventure tables:\n\n\n\n1D6\nEVENTS: THE MARINA\n\n\n\n\n1\nObjective achieved: The characters are in front of\n\n\n2\nMisunderstanding and misunderstanding\n\n\n3\nShouldn’t you have turned right?\n\n\n4\nSurprise visit\n\n\n5\nAttentive and discreet people\n\n\n6\nUnexpected face to face\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nADVENTURES: THE YACHT\n\n\n\n\n1\nObjective achieved: the characters access the\n\n\n2\nCupboards full of things…\n\n\n3\nStrange and disturbing noises…\n\n\n4\nMidnight swim!\n\n\n5\nUnfortunate coincidences\n\n\n6\nAlarm bells ringing…",

    "text": "Events and rumours\n\nBut if there is a greater lesson to be learned from what happened in the clearing, it is the simple fact that the real gladiators of the world gladiators of the world are of such humble origin and so commonplace in appearance that if you stand in line behind them in a grocery shop, you can’t guess how much the fire of their souls can light up the darkness.\n—James Lee Burke, Swan Lake\n\nA nanoChrome campaign can be played in a sandbox style. The game leader sets events and mysteries and lets the players deal with them. The success criteria of the stories and missions provide sufficient guidance so that the players always know where to go and what to do: they just have to act in such a way as to find the answers to the questions. From then on, the leader can let himself be carried along by events.\nTo get the action going again, you have several tools at your disposal:\n\nStart a new story line or mission request: the town doesn’t stop spinning because the characters are investigating a case or working on a mission. In fact, it’s much more interesting when they find themselves drowning in the need to investigate three or four different leads at once. As they close cases and send in their reports or respond to their employers, you can add game material. Load up the boat, let them chase every bone you throw them and insist on more. They will hate you and yet love the story.\nGet The Other to act: The Other does not sit still. It has its own goals and it sets them in motion at its own pace. This is how the world gradually evolves. Normally you have to wait for a cycle to pass, but if the characters don’t take the initiative, too bad for them…\nAsk the players to invent rumours or events in the town: you can use the table below as a guide to trigger or inspire these rumours - or leave it to the players.

A crisis is just a bad moment, an additional complication in an already complicated life. It usually concerns only one character, but he can of course drag his companions into the mess.\nWhen a problem has been solved, it yields 20 XP and 3 connection points.\nYou can also give the list to the players: each one chooses one in secret at the beginning of the adventure. They can play it whenever they want on themselves or on one of their little friends. For the sake of mischief and to the delight of the rest of the table.

You can’t leave them like this.\n\n\n2.2\nLOCAL DIPLOMACY\nYour squat has some problems with troublesome neighbors, and you’re in charge of dealing with it. You’ll need a good dose of patience and diplomacy, unless you opt for the punch-in-the-face method…\n\n\n2.3\nMISSING PERSON\nA buddy, a brother, or an acquaintance is nowhere to be found. What kind of mess has he gotten himself into this time? He might have left you a worried message, and no one has seen him since.\n\n\n2.4\nMISTAKEN IDENTITY\nYou’re mistaken for someone else, and of course, it’s not to give you flowers or congratulate you. These people won’t let you go because of a few protests, and they are dangerous.\n\n\n2.5\nOUTBREAK OF VIOLENCE\nYou witness an outbreak of violence that will leave physical or emotional scars, or even involve you more than you’d like.\n\n\n2.6\nFRUSTRATION\nSometimes, the cup is full. You explode angrily. For now, people are just afraid of you. But tomorrow, you’ll have to deal with the stares and complaints.\n\n\n3.1\nGROUPIE\nAfter a brilliant act, someone is obsessed with you. For now, they’re harmless, but with this kind of crackpot, you never know what might happen.\n\n\n3.2\nHANGOVER\nHere come those rough mornings when you can’t remember how you ended up there, when the slightest noise gives you a migraine that would knock out a COPA. What happened last night?\n\n\n3.3\nLOVE STORY\nYou’re in love, but couple life is sometimes complicated, whether the story is in full swing or you’re settled into a routine.\n\n\n3.4\nFESTIVAL DAY\nYou don’t like festivals. Impossible to get around, do errands, or reach your contacts. Nothing seems to work normally.\n\n\n3.5\nTHE HEAT\nThose corporate security jerks are overzealous tonight. Insults, beatings? Either you’re at the station for more thorough “verifications,” or you’re on the run with half the corpo cops on your tail.\n\n\n3.6\nBURYING THE HATCHET\nYou made the wrong joke to the wrong person. Everyone had a good laugh, but you saw it in their eyes: war is declared. It’s not going to end there… oh no!\n\n\n4.1\nMURPHY’S LAW\nToday is a bad day, and it’s only just begun. Whatever you do today, it’s going to turn into a nightmare.\n\n\n4.2\nTHE EXES\nAn ex comes back into your life: they need a favor from you, or vice versa; it’s pure chance working things out (or not); it’s a pleasant surprise (or not)…\n\n\n4.3\nILLNESS\nSomeone is sick. Maybe you. You’ll have to run around everywhere to find increasingly rare and expensive medications.\n\n\n4.4\nBAD IDEA\nYou’re dragged into a bad plan, a first-class mess. You’re not responsible for your friends, family, or clients, but when their problems start to concern you, it’s already too late.\n\n\n4.5\nBAD PRESS\nThe media is cruel, and you find yourself their target without quite understanding why. Does the journalist think they have a scoop, or are they pursuing you with some sort of personal hatred? Unless they were paid to destroy you.\n\n\n4.6\nLONG FUSE\nYour past comes back to haunt you. You made some mistakes back in the day, and now it’s time to pay the bill.\n\n\n5.1\nSUDDEN DEATH\nSomeone has died. This death may or may not affect you emotionally, but it certainly forces you to reconsider your plans for the day.\n\n\n5.2\nIMPROVISED NANNY\nYou’ve inherited a kid for the day – the mother thrust them into your arms and bolted, claiming urgent matters. You’ll quickly realize this is far from a little angel!\n\n\n5.3\nPERSONAL PAGE\nSomeone has tampered with your personal page on the WakuWaku social network. It pisses you off, for sure, but it’s not without consequences.\n\n\n5.4\nBREAKDOWN\nSomething breaks down at the worst possible moment, and guess who has to fix the problem. And in the meantime, you’ll have to do the work by hand since the machine has given up the ghost.\n\n\n5.5\nAPPOINTMENT\nYou have an important appointment, the kind you can’t miss, and it falls right in the middle of something else equally crucial. You’ll have to find a solution.\n\n\n5.6\nREVELATIONS\nSomeone close trusts you enough to make very personal, very disturbing, or downright bizarre revelations to you. Except it’s much more than you can handle.\n\n\n6.1\nRIPPED OFF\nYou had a contract, but the other party didn’t honor their commitments – shoddy or undelivered equipment, false information. You’ll have to kick some asses, and something tells you your night isn’t over yet.\n\n\n6.2\nABSENT-MINDED\nToday you’re tired, in love, or obsessed with your problems. You don’t retain anything you’re told, and you forget half of what you’re asked to do.\n\n\n6.3\nA DEMANDING JOB\nThere are problems at the squat, and the caretaker has summoned you. He’s furious, overwhelmed, stressed, and this needs to be sorted out before anything else… You’re not going to be idle!\n\n\n6.4\nA SMALL FAVOR\nYou’re asked for a favor you can’t refuse. You said yes reflexively, without thinking about the real consequences of your answer, and now you’re stuck.\n\n\n6.5\nFAMILY VISIT\nMembers of your family are coming to visit - but as often, nothing is simple. They’re very nice, but really cumbersome and tiring.\n\n\n6.6\nVOLUNTEER\nYou have something to do for the squat, a thankless job for which you can expect no recognition, but someone has to do it. And of course, it’s on a day when everything is complicated.",

A small job consists of putting your abilities and skills at the service of people who have immediate needs in marginal areas: delivering a package of accelerators somewhere, guarding a cyber chop shop for the time of a sensitive intervention for a local kingpin, using your CPA to go and unload contraband in a remote cove, going to collect money from a Shylock’s debtors, etc. In short, nothing but legal and unpaid work.

    "text": "Corporations\n\nBut Brian was not fooled. In the face of competition from global markets, sovereign states could do little to stem the pressures of finance and global trade, or else they would alienate investors and threaten their GDP: the role of states was now confined to maintaining order and security in the midst the new global disorder led by centrifugal, extraterritorial forces, elusive forces. No one believed in progress any more: the world had become uncertain, precarious, but most decision-makers agreed that the world had become uncertain, precarious, but most decision-makers of this phantom system, while waiting for the end of the catastrophe. The excluded were pushed to the outskirts of the megacities, reserved for the winners of an anthropophagous game where television, sport and the pipolisation of the void channelled individual frustrations, in the absence of collective perspectives.\n—Caryl Férey, Zulu\n\nIn nanoChrome, the characters have a lot to do with corporations - whether they work for them, attack them or spy on them, whether they plunder them or render them meaningful services.\nCorporation: a catch-all term for any company or business, profit-making or not, that has a logo, a name, a front on the matrix and possibly offices somewhere (which isn’t even a requirement any more). Of course, people tend to imagine that all corporations are transnationals or even orbitals, with hundreds of thousands of employees. In reality, most are small - even if they are all owned, through cross-holdings, holdings, pension funds and other capital managers, by only a few people in the world.\nBut a corporation is a more or less complicated organisation, and it’s people who work more or less together, with their good and bad sides. In short, it’s a microcosm that you have to make live, in all its diversity, so that all corporations don’t end up looking the same.\nSo here are a few different tables that should inspire you…\n\nTo begin with, you may want to compose a vague organisation chart of the corporation. At the top, you have the board of directors and the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) who is the managing director. Then you have lots of COs (CFO, COO, CSO, CBO…) with various titles to put around them. In good French, this means Human Resources Director, Financial Director, Administrative Director, Compliance Director, etc. Underneath all this fine laundry, organise departments. The bigger the company, the more departments it has; the more different areas it deals with, the more departments it has. You will almost always find certain departments: general services, accounting, human resources. For the rest, have fun building something funny and impossible to understand. Put some names for the known managers and add some stories.\n\n\n\n\n1D666\nDEPARTMENTS AND SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1\nReception and representation\n\n\n1.1.2\nProcurement\n\n\n1.1.3\nGeneral administration\n\n\n1.1.4\nAkashic\n\n\n1.1.5\nArchives\n\n\n1.1.6\nInsurance\n\n\n1.2.1\nInternal audit\n\n\n1.2.2\nSocial benefits\n\n\n1.2.3\nTrainee’s office\n\n\n1.2.4\nClients\n\n\n1.2.5\nAccounting\n\n\n1.2.6\nConsumption\n\n\n1.3.1\nExternal contracts\n\n\n1.3.2\nCounter-espionage\n\n\n1.3.3\nCost control\n\n\n1.3.4\nMail\n\n\n1.3.5\nCreative\n\n\n1.3.6\nDesign\n\n\n1.4.1\nRetail\n\n\n1.4.2\nDevelopment\n\n\n1.4.3\nLocal management\n\n\n1.4.4\nProduct division\n\n\n1.4.5\nWarehouses and stocks\n\n\n1.4.6\nEnvironment\n\n\n1.5.1\nEvaluation and estimates\n\n\n1.5.2\nManufacturing\n\n\n1.5.3\nBilling\n\n\n1.5.4\nFinance\n\n\n1.5.5\nCharitable foundation\n\n\n1.5.6\nContinuing education\n\n\n1.6.1\nHealth and safety\n\n\n1.6.2\nIndustrial\n\n\n1.6.3\nIT\n\n\n1.6.4\nEngineering\n\n\n1.6.5\nInvestment\n\n\n1.6.6\nLegal\n\n\n2.1.1\nLitigation\n\n\n2.1.2\nLogistics\n\n\n2.1.3\nMaintenance\n\n\n2.1.4\nMarketing\n\n\n2.1.5\nTrademarks and patents\n\n\n2.1.6\nPackaging\n\n\n2.2.1\nVehicle fleet\n\n\n2.2.2\nInternal complaints\n\n\n2.2.3\nPlanning\n\n\n2.2.4\nPromotion and media\n\n\n2.2.5\nCleanliness\n\n\n2.2.6\nProspects\n\n\n2.3.1\nManagement protection\n\n\n2.3.2\nPsychological\n\n\n2.3.3\nQuality\n\n\n2.3.4\nResearch\n\n\n2.3.5\nRecruitment\n\n\n2.3.6\nPublic relations\n\n\n2.4.1\nIntelligence\n\n\n2.4.2\nHuman Resources\n\n\n2.4.3\nRisks\n\n\n2.4.4\nHealth and occupational health\n\n\n2.4.5\nExecutive Secretariat\n\n\n2.4.6\nGeneral Secretariat\n\n\n2.5.1\nSecurity\n\n\n2.5.2\nTour Operator Service\n\n\n2.5.3\nDomestic Services\n\n\n2.5.4\nGeneral Services\n\n\n2.5.5\nSubcontracting\n\n\n2.5.6\nSwitchboard\n\n\n2.6.1\nStatistics\n\n\n2.6.2\nTechnical\n\n\n2.6.3\nTransport\n\n\n2.6.4\nEconomic intelligence\n\n\n2.6.5\nLegal and compliance monitoring\n\n\n2.6.6\nTechnology watch\n\n\n3.x.x\nReroll\n\n\n4.x.x\nReroll\n\n\n5.x.x\nReroll\n\n\n6.x.x\nReroll\n\n\n\nYou need to populate the corporation with employees with different profiles, complex expectations and ambivalent attitudes.

    "text": "Gangs\n\n“Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube\nFrom the gang called Niggaz With Attitudes\nWhen I’m called off, I got a sawed off\nSqueeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off\nYou too, boy, if ya fuck with me”\n—N.W.A., Straight outta Compton\n\nThe anarzones are full of gangs. But so are the conurbs, and even the enclaves. A gang is a bunch of guys and gals, all born somewhere and never left - at least in their heads. As a matter of principle, they all engage in diverse and wide-ranging criminal activities - it’s really a way of life - and employ violence with a readiness that can sometimes be surprising, against other gangs of course but also against just about anything they consider a threat or an insult. When confronted with gangsters, it’s best to have a big gun and be prepared to use it mercilessly - or look down, hand over your wallet and move on.\nLet’s be clear: gangsters are stupid to the last degree, who communicate only through violence, and who don’t even bother to conceal their activities or their crimes any more. If they are caught, they go to jail: it’s good for their reputation in the group, like a virginity that must be lost to gain respect. If they die, it doesn’t matter: they are dead.\nAnd the little ones they leave behind pick up the torch. To some extent, gangers are the goblins of cyberpunk! You can of course, and rightly so, blame economic conditions, endemic poverty, lack of education - and frankly, hang the city planners with the politicians’ guts - but the situation has been going on for so long now in nanoChrome (a century or two probably - some of the oldest gangs have been around since before World War II!) that there’s not much you can do about it…\nIn nanoChrome, you absolutely have to play the gangs seriously. They are fools, but armed, dangerous, determined fools, who are not afraid of anything (so foolish). Their violence is relentless, sudden, absurd, impulsive. They don’t always react with the logic one would expect from a human being normed by society. Their standards are really too foreign for that…\n\nGangs are directly responsible for two-thirds of Chrome City’s violent crime - murders, assaults, robberies, rapes, etc.\nThey are mainly territorial, but they have managed to organise themselves into networks of franchises to facilitate their various trades: drugs, weapons, slaves, organs, blood… The most important gangs are now transnational (and perhaps orbital…)\nA gang is not a small group of ten or so individuals stuck in a street. Gangs range from several thousand to tens of thousands of members. One can consider that 1% or more of the total population of Chrome City belongs to a gang (these are perfectly realistic figures!). They are therefore dangerous gangs and it is not enough to be called Charles Bronson to eliminate them all after a good fight. Hence the constant danger of getting involved with them - revenge is not an empty word. Nevertheless, gangs are very often divided into smaller cliques, a few dozen individuals in a neighbourhood.\nGangs are, for the most part, ethnic and cultural. One joins a gang that shares religious values, cultural celebrations, eating habits, and the language of one’s childhood. Nevertheless, many gangs are relatively open as long as the ganger adopts the culture of reference.\nViolence and cruelty are one of the main markers of gang definition. Assault, rape, murder, torture, mutilation are normal. You shoot a guy for revenge and cut up his family in the bathtub to make a point. You aim at a guy on a bus and decapitate all the passengers. You have to kill the teacher at your school to get into the gang. A pretty girl is taken, tattooed (to mark the property) and raped. You do something stupid? The whole gang beats you up until you fall. Do two things wrong? They stick one in the back of your head. That’s normal. A guy looks at you the wrong way? You smoke him - and his girl will have a great time in your arms.\n\nIn short: gangers are not carefree.\nTo finish with these happy thoughts, don’t forget that the various mafia groups are gangs in their own right - just a bit more established: the difference between a cult and a church… And then add to this the fact that the various mafia groups are also gangs. And then throw in bikers, survivalists, neo-Nazis, some ‘religious’ sects and you’ve got some good opportunities to shake up your characters with some very scary threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nGANG RELATIONSHIP\n\n\n\n\n1\nPROTECTION Families and relatives providing support to gang members without being part of the gang.\n\n\n2\nAT RISK Kids in the neighbourhood who do favours and will eventually join the gang.\n\n\n3\nASSOCIATES Uninitiated teenage members who gravitate to the gang, consider themselves part of it and learn the ropes.\n\n\n4\nMEMBERS who only associate with other members and are fully initiated. Responsible for daily activities and protection.\n\n\n5\nVETERANs are fully invested in the gang and have no other cultural background. They usually have good prison experience.\n\n\n6\nLEADER Usually the oldest and the one with the lightest criminal record.

They are the repository of legitimate violence. In short, they are a gang like any other, but this one is in the service of the powerful. In nanoChrome, the powers are varied - corporations, nations, cities, etc. - And they’ll be up the asses of the characters in the game. And they’ll be on the characters’ asses at one point or another.\n\nGeneral organisation\nThe police have three main functions:\n\nAdministrative police: to prevent disturbances, ensure the tranquillity, safety and health of the city’s inhabitants - especially those in charge. People will have to deal with the police when they are loitering in guarded areas for no reason or when they need to obtain papers, authorisations and other important documents.\nJudicial police: bringing criminals to justice. As soon as the characters cross the line of the law - for example, by opening fire outside the anarzones or dealing accelerants with a few known gangsters - they’ll have investigators on their tail. This is the fun part of your job as a leader…\nPolitical police: monitor, coerce and eliminate opponents of a certain social and moral order. These are far more dangerous than criminals and gangsters… It is obvious that those who harm the interests of corporations fall into this category and the Panopticom cells in particular. Remember that political police officers rarely bother with legality, judgements and other human rights. They have special prisons, interrogation centres, well-concealed cesspools and vast anonymous cemeteries.\n\n\n\nMunicipal police (ConUrbs)\nThis police department, based on an “American-style” model, is organised into four divisions under the authority of the Office of the Chief of Police. Each division is headed by a Deputy Chief.\n\nTHE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE\n\nThe Chief of Police (COP) is appointed by the highest authority in the city - the Mayor. The Chief of Police (COP) is appointed by the city’s highest authority - the mayor and is responsible for the overall management of the police department.\nThe administrative secretariat coordinates and supports the daily activities of the COP - mail management, organisation of staff meetings, handling of complaints and requests from officers and the public, research and development of special projects…\nThe Quality Office is under the direct responsibility of the COP. They are the internal services of the police department: they investigate all complaints concerning the conduct of officers and enforce discipline.\nPublic Relations is the front of the Police Department and liaises with the community and journalists, providing all relevant information. PR organizes commemorations, award ceremonies, memorials, funerals, etc. and advises the OPC and his deputies on communication matters.\n\n\n\nField division\n\nThe Field Division is the largest of the divisions. It deals with uni form patrols, assigned to areas divided into sectors. Its officers are in direct contact with the population and have the mission of enforcing the laws and protecting the inhabitants. It is essentially an administrative police force: it intervenes to prevent crimes and offences from being committed. The characters will have to deal with the officers of the Field Division whenever they have a suspicious behaviour. Equality, justice, professionalism and rigour do not prevent racial profiling - quite the contrary.\nEach zone is under the command of a major who is responsible for its administration and reports to the Deputy Head of the Division. The zone captains act as a link between the major and the sergeants and take over the major’s duties when he is absent. Zone Lieutenants ensure that the rotas are working properly; they prepare the daily assignments, monitor discipline, manage the working time of the teams, evaluate the performance of the officers and sergeants and develop local action plans to fight crime. Administrative sergeants take roll call, manage schedules, investigate discipline problems and accidents. Sector sergeants supervise the operations of patrol officers, evaluate their work, review reports for clarification and completion, and supervise special activities.\nSeveral specialists are assigned to each area: a criminal analyst checks the M.O. of criminals, enters information into databases, receives victims, and maintains an up-to-date daily crime bulletin; an akashic analyst is responsible for processing real-time matrix searches for patrol officers; security inspectors monitor community-related criminal cases, arrange meetings with the public, and conduct interviews; field investigators investigate robberies, narcotics cases, misdemeanors, and simple crimes as assigned by the zone commanders.\nThe Field Division also oversees the special operations department: special and normal event monitoring, drone surveillance and response, checkpoints, hit-and-run, Red Dog Units, SWAT, CPA patrols, K-9 units, bomb disposal, etc. Special operations officers are called in to reinforce their colleagues when needed, to manage hostage situations and bomb threats, to organise and monitor vehicle pursuits in the event of a hit-and-run, to identify and clear abandoned vehicles, to impose a visible and powerful presence in the most sensitive areas and to manage all the checkpoints set up at the entrances to the anarzones.\n\n\n\nCriminal investigation division\n\nThe Investigation Division is made up of several independent units, spread throughout the city. They are responsible for the investigation and follow-up of criminal cases involving people or property. All major investigations are conducted by detectives and inspectors assigned to this division.\nThe most prestigious unit in the Division is the Homicide Squad, but there are also several special and independent units: Youth and Family Protection Unit; Special Investigations Unit; and a section attached to the Prosecutor’s Office.\nThis Division is also responsible for the forensic resources: analysis and trace laboratories, coroner’s services, ballistics, genetic laboratory, nanodrones in the field, etc.; as well as the Akashic Investigation Department, which deals specifically with matrix crimes and special operations in this field.\n\n\n\nTechnical services division\n\nThis division provides the communication and technical means for the other divisions. It is made up of several offices: Communications; IT; General Services; Records and Archives; Seals; Mechanical and Fleet Services; and Impound.\n\n\n\nAdministrative division\n\nThis division provides administrative and logistical support to all other divisions. It is responsible for the initial recruitment, vetting and training of applicants; manages budgets and schedules; manages the department’s property and possessions, including seizures; and researches, tests and purchases equipment provided to officers, including vehicles, weapons, uniforms and toilet paper…\n\n\n\n\nCorporate security (enclaves)\nCorporatist security services do not have quite the same goals and duties as street cops. They serve and protect the interests of their bosses and shareholders, not the public. Strangely, however, they have almost more difficulty in doing their job.\nFirst of all, let’s differentiate here between the standard security services and the operational corporatist agents that the characters may face. The latter rarely respond to the security services - they are much more often employed in the team of their direct sponsor (as special secretaries, for example). The security services are under the direction of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and have much more general duties. The characters will have to deal with the corporate agents if they get noticed by the wrong people; but they will have to manage the security services to avoid being noticed…\nThe problem with corporatist security services is that they are a hindrance. They never facilitate the smooth running of business and reduce the speed at which projects develop. In any case, this is how they are perceived by all the other departments: it has to be said that badging a door twenty times a day or submitting to random searches tends to irritate employees; and managers find it hard to fill in endless papers and notes for the slightest trip or meeting… As a result, their greatest enemies are sometimes the employees themselves, who do things half-heartedly or recriminate at the slightest constraints.\nAnd then, the bosses - the board of directors, the shareholders - sometimes ask that the departments be a little more flexible. It’s all about the smooth running of the business!\nDepending on the needs, security services can be centralised - fully attached to the parent company’s offices and managing all operations - or decentralised - each corporate unit has its own services adapted to local needs. Or a mixture of both.\nThe list of tasks for the security services is quite impressive (and probably not exhaustive), but it gives an idea of what the characters may have to face if they seek to harm a corpo - their analysts are prepared for all eventualities…\n\nForensic analysis\nEconomic and industrial counter-espionage\nContinuous monitoring of personnel (drug tests, surprise searches, bank investigations…)\nRecruitment control\nStrategic development\nInternal investigations\nAccess management and identity control\nInsurance management and legal compliance\nEvent management and security\nAnti-fraud and accounting monitoring\nBusiness continuity and accident/disaster management\nImplementation of internal regulations, maintenance of discipline\nData protection\nRespect for privacy\nAkashic security\nSecurity of premises and possessions\nSecurity of tools and applications\nNetwork security\nSecurity and electronic countermeasures\nSecurity and control of subcontractors\nPhysical security of managers and employees\nThreat monitoring and vulnerability assessment\n\n\n\nOn the wrong side of investigations\nAll this leads to the fun part of this chapter. Most of the time, the characters commit a lot of crimes and, if they are not caught in the act (just to start a good fight), the game leader rarely follows up… Except that investigators don’t let go of their prey easily if they have something to chase!\nThe general principle of this tool is as follows: the investigators can make skill rolls to find the characters if they have committed a crime or an offence. The difficulty depends on the crime and the clues the characters may have left behind - at the discretion of the leader who will use the following tables. If the roll is successful, the investigators find them; if not, it’s a dead end (until new information is found).\nWe have chosen not to give precise figures so as not to scare you: the lists are, like all the lists in this book, invitations and inspirations. But, as a general rule, start from a given difficulty level (18 for example). Add +2 when circumstances are favourable to the characters and -2 when circumstances are unfavourable, for each of the items you may find appropriate. In the end, you will probably have a long list of + and -’s that will partly cancel each other out, but not totally.\nGenerally, the Investigation roll is made on the next cycle after the crime or misdemeanour; if it is successful, the characters will probably have trouble in the next cycle; if it is unsuccessful, the investigators can roll again in the next cycle with a substantial increase in difficulty.\n\nOn patrol\nDo the characters get spotted by a patrol while going about their business? You can use the characters’ Stealth roll (in cooperation) to set the difficulty of the cops’ skill roll and adjust it according to several factors:\n\nAre the characters in a group? In pairs? Alone and isolated?\nAre the characters behaving suspiciously? Suspicious appearance (for the neighbourhood)? Suspicious material? Do they run or try to hide awkwardly?\nAre the characters known to the police? Are they wanted? Is their description broadcast? Is it accurate, vague or erroneous?\nIs the street deserted or is it crowded? What is the neighbourhood? Abandoned alleys? The underside of a motorway bridge? A street lined with villas? A square between corporate buildings?\nIs it dark? Dark night? Is it sunny?\nDo the cops have drones in the air? Dogs on the ground? Do the characters have akashic programs activated?\nWhat is the level of security in the neighbourhood?\n\n\n\nInvestigations\nOnce the crime has been committed, how do the characters get out of it? The initial difficulty depends, globally, on the actions of the characters and the nature of the crime. The more important, spectacular, bloody, or involving influential victims the crime is, the lower the initial difficulty - the cops go to great lengths to get to the bottom of it.\n\nAre the characters caught red-handed? In the immediate vicinity? Are they in possession of stolen goods?\nAre there any witnesses? Physical? Akashic? Electronic?\nHave the characters spoken? Exchanged names? Used a known modus operandi? Adopted significant behaviours? Were they in disguise?\nWere the characters violent? Intimidating? Discreet? Invisible?\nDid the characters leave any traces? Fingerprints? Tools? DNA? Materials from their hideout or from their normal life (Locard principle)? Did they use nanodrones for cover?\nIs there a financial trail that can be followed?\nDoes the crime have a recognisable motive? Is it possible to understand the motives of the characters?\nIs there an akashic trail?\nDo the characters have accomplices? Did they tell anyone about their crime? Did they need help before or after? Can anyone sell the characters out or turn them in? Do they try to pass on stolen goods?\nAre the characters already known to the police? Are they registered? Are they wanted?\nDo they have an alibi? Do they have a good reputation? Are they protected?\nAre there signs that a crime has been committed (theft, body, signs of a struggle, etc.)?\nCan the police easily investigate? Corporate blockades? Hostile anarzone?\nDo the cops have a personal interest in going through with it? Can they be broken? Do they have too much work to do? Do they take the victim in sympathy or antipathy?\nCan the cops do searches? Can the cops search? Can the cops search the characters? Question their relatives?\n\n\n\nSuspects\nOnce the investigation is successful, the cops will come down on the characters. But first there will probably be surveillance (physical, electronic, akashic), stakeouts, tailing, searches.\nAnd arrest.\nRemember that cops will prefer to arrest characters separately, at the same time, with maximum security: the quiet middleman will have two detectives coming to him as he leaves the restaurant; the ultra-violent swordsman will be picked off in the middle of the night by a SWAT team and reinforcements outside.\nIf it’s corporatist agents who intervene, let’s just say things might not be as calm: how do your players behave when they’re the ones on the right side of the gun? Do the same. A bullet in the head, direct, or subtle negotiations: it’s up to them…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurban zones have their own security level, rated from 0 for anarzones to 10 for the most secure anti-zones, passing by 1 to 3 for conurbs and 4 to 7 for enclaves. Add this level of security to the difficulties of the jets in chatting to the authorities, hiding, camouflaging weapons, etc.",

    "text": "Creating an adventure\nTo create an adventure, make four draws from the following tables.\n\nThe first draw is how the story begins…\nThe second draw is the mission the characters (or villains) are given.\nThe third draw is the location where most of the adventure will take place.\nThe final draw indicates the main opponent they will ultimately face.\n\nThe way it starts, the introduction, the hook: this is how you start the adventure. It can be a simple announcement, but you can also set the scene for the whole event and make it more complicated or more fun for the players. Most often, it will be the Client who arrives with a problem to solve and some ¥ to entice the characters to accept the contract; but it can also be information gleaned from the matrix or events that happen to the characters. The hook can be either before the mission order (and triggers the adventure) or after (and is where it all begins).\nThe mission order: this gives you the theme of the story you are telling. It’s a simple objective that the characters will have to meet in order to succeed. From there, your job as game leader will be to set up obstacles and mysteries, place formidable opponents and turn the game into a sort of endless rollercoaster ride of twists, surprises and revelations. The mission order can also be given to other people - these are the people that a Panopticom team can investigate after the mission has been completed.\nThe location of the adventure: this is the main place where everything will happen in the end. Of course, if you’re not lazy, you can pull in an extra location or two to add more places to visit, but normally you should have plenty to do with this one location. In any case, as soon as they know enough to go there, ask them what they know. This could be rumours they have picked up on the matrix, things they have learned on previous visits, information they have read or heard. Go round the table a couple of times: each player has to give one piece of information. This can be true or false, or just inaccurate. Use these elements to dress up the scene, add twists, dangers or obstacles.\nThe main adversary: The last die point indicates the main adversary of the characters, the one who is going to get in their way or who is directly competing with them for the mission. If you’ve already drawn this opponent in previous adventures, that’s fine: it’s the return of the son of vengeance. A good recurring extra is always good to have. If he’s been eliminated before, don’t worry: he’s back with a nice scar and a heightened desire for revenge, unless it’s his son, his brother or another relative.\n\n\n\n1D66\nHOW THE STORY

    "text": "Complications\nOnce you have drawn the first four points of the adventure, you need to flesh it out and provide some additional elements. To do this, simply answer the following questions. You can answer all of them or just some - you can even add to the sheet during the course of the adventure depending on the actions of the characters.\n\n1. What can go wrong?\nA mission is rarely fun. When the circumstances are against the characters, everything becomes more complicated.\n\n\n\n1D26\nSOME UNWELCOME COMPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nDifficult material circumstances\n\n\n1.2\nComplicated personal events\n\n\n1.3\nMissing relevant information\n\n\n1.4\nVery specific material (or a single object) is\n\n\n1.5\nThe mission order is a fake or has been changed\n\n\n1.6\nIt’s a trap!\n\n\n2.1\nYou have to find and use a specific means of\n\n\n2.2\nYou have to convince someone to go with you first\n\n\n2.3\nThere is breakage and things to fix\n\n\n2.4\nPolitical, economic, personal conditions are\n\n\n2.5\nAn urgent secondary mission must be accomplished\n\n\n2.6\nComplex and potentially dramatic local events\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Who opposes the characters and why?\nThe characters are not the only ones on the case. We’re not talking about the mission’s opponent here. We’re talking about competition. There are other people hanging around. Why are they here?\n\n\n\n1D6\nWHAT THEY WANT\n\n\n\n\n1\nThey are just annoying the characters to annoy their\n\n\n2\nThey immediately need the characters for something\n\n\n3\nTheir story has absolutely nothing to do with the\n\n\n4\nTheir objectives are completely different but target\n\n\n5\nTheir objectives are directly opposed\n\n\n6\nTheir objectives are the same but for different\n\n\n\nThese antagonists should start to appear early on in the story, in the early stages.

Would the characters have a good reason to abandon the mission or change its terms?\nCharacters are not always able to complete their mission - unless they perform extraordinary feats (but that is what is expected of them). Sometimes they have to choose between their safety and that of their allies, between their lives and their ideals. What will their choice be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D6\nA GOOD REASON TO GIVE UP\n\n\n\n\n1\nAppearances are deceptive; the mission is reversed\n\n\n2\nCharacters face major legal risks or risk doing something very stupid\n\n\n3\nThe characters will have to deny their honour or commit a terrible act (such as causing the death of a child)\n\n\n4\nThe characters will lose something important (their weapon of choice, a close person, an alliance…)\n\n\n5\nA second story, something huge appears; a choice has to be made between two objectives\n\n\n6\nToo much opposition\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Do I want to put down an important element of the universe or the story I am telling?\nYou must have an idea in the back of your mind about what is happening in your part of the world. Sooner or later you will start to develop bits of story and you will want to place them. Use this adventure to do so: the mission will allow the characters to discover some very important secrets. What are they? How will they find out? What will be the consequences of their discoveries?\n\n\n5. Is there an extra, a setting, an event that I really want to stage?\nCome on, there must be a scene you have in mind. A really hot situation. Something that’s going to make the players go wild. Special effects, unique descriptions that you’ve been inspired by dreams or by trolling the illustration sites on the internet. Go for it. Throw the sauce, think big, don’t skimp on the means - they don’t cost you anything. Do it right and do it big! No regrets!",

This is not a new idea, we agree - there are plenty of Urban Fantasy worlds, but very few with a cyberpunk setting. Nevertheless, what we wouldn’t do for a little exoticism?\nSee what your players think of the idea and if everyone agrees, go for it. Beware though, the appearance of magic does not mean that the world will be all pastel, unicorns and rainbows. Magic can be a nasty thing and no one can trust a dragon!\nAdd the following fundamental to the first three given in the first chapter (page 13).\nIt had to happen sometime. By dint of playing with ever longer subatomic racetracks to observe Higgs bosons and tobacco pot gluons, researchers blew it up. One chance in a million, they said.\nWhat happened? A coiled dimension suddenly unfolded - physicists know that extra dimensions (beyond the first four) do exist, in the form of microscopic toroids that were formed just after the Big Bang. What was not known was that the dimension in question had an existence of its own and that it was home to particular energies and fauna.\nIn short, overnight this new dimension was imposed on the world - so that we had to deal with the three physical dimensions, a fourth time dimension and a fifth, very real dimension, which was soon called the Æther.\nThe Æther caused some major upheavals in the world:",

This total is reduced for each item of cybernetics you wear, including cosmetic prosthetics, and for each wound you suffer. The use of magic is limited by pain and all things that tie the body to its own sensations. You recover all your magic points after a full night’s sleep.\n\n\nPhysical and magical defences\nThere are two different defences - physical and magical - which are calculated in the same way (Wisdom + 7). However, physical protections do not increase magical defence and conversely, magical protections have no effect against physical attacks. When a wizard casts an Ethereal Barrier spell, for example, he must choose whether to affect one or the other defence, but he can cast the spell twice to cover all options.\nSimilarly, some creatures have only one magical defence. It is impossible to hit them with physical attacks. Conversely, physical objects have no magical defence and magical attacks have no effect on them.\n\n\nNew abilities\nMYSTIC ADEPT: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. You can cast spells like hermeticists and orphists. However, you have two limitations: you can only cast spells whose level is equal to or lower than your Intelligence rank; you cannot summon spirits.\nÆTHERIC AFFINITY: You have two extra magic points per day.\nSPEED: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. Add twice your Dexterity rank to your initiative. It does not cost any magic points. You can gain 1d6 extra initiative points for each magic point you invest.\nCONTROL: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. You can impose major deprivations on your body by spending magic points: one point per minute to stop breathing, one per hour to remain completely immobile, two per night to not sleep (but you don’t get any magic or life points back in the morning), etc. You can go several days without eating and drinking very little.\nMAGIC FORTRESS: you must be an alchemist to choose this ability. The resistances and defences you gain also apply to your magic defence.\nRAPID HEALING: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. You regain 1d6 hit points for every hour of rest or quiet activity. In addition, you recover 2d3 wounds each round instead of 1d3.\nMAGE OF HERMES: If you are a hermeticist, you belong to the Order of Hermes and can use its facilities and libraries.\nBATTLE MAGE: Add 1d6 to all damage you inflict with magic.\nINSTICTIVE MAGE: If you are a hermeticist or orphist, you can make magical attacks without spending any magic. Make an Intelligence roll to hit, against the target’s (magical) defence, and calculate the damage normally.\nLODGE MEMBER: You belong to a major Orphic lodge and can use its facilities and libraries.\nPOWER: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. Add 1d6 (explosive) to all damage you deal in close combat. This does not cost a magic point. You can add 1d6 (non-explosive) damage for each point of magic you invest in the move.\nRAMPART: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. Add your Constitution to your defence. This does not cost any magic points. You can gain +1 defence for the round for each magic point you invest.\nSAIL: You must be an alchemist to choose this ability. For 1 magic point, you go unnoticed and people ignore you.",

    "text": "Magic powers\nHermetics and Orphists both possess the ability to cast spells and summon ethereal spirits.\n\nSpells\nThe magic still works and you do not have to make any rolls. Use an action and spend one magic point per spell level. If you do not have enough magic points, the spell does not work.\nGenerally speaking, the effects of spells are instantaneous (or very short) or end with the next dawn or dusk. Most spells work on contact (including all spells intended to aid one’s allies) or on sight; a few spells, such as Message, work beyond the normal range of perception.\nIf a creature can make a saving throw to escape one of your spells, the difficulty of the saving throw is equal to 10 + your Wisdom. If you are wearing a magical focuser (staff, magic symbol, etc), add the bonus of that to the difficulty.\n\nLevel 1\n\nASSISTANCE: You grant a +4 bonus to a roll that you or a companion must make. This bonus does not stack with the use of a skill.\nMINOR ILLUSION: You create a small auditory or visual illusion within sight. Onlookers can make a saving throw to ignore the illusion, but only if they suspect it is something abnormal.\nLIGHT: A bright light appears that follows you everywhere and illuminates like a beautiful lamp until you extinguish it. You can concentrate it to give it the appearance and use of a high-power directional flash-light.\nMESSAGE: You send a short message to a person you know.\nÆTHERIC PERCEPTION: You detect magic and see into the Æther up to your Intelligence in meters. You can also use this spell to analyse a scene from a magical point of view.\n\n\n\nLevel 2\n\nÆTHERIC BARRIER: You grant a +1 defence bonus to yourself or a companion for the duration of one combat. Each person can only receive one Ætheric barrier of a specific type at a time, but you can cast it on multiple people if you have enough magic points. You must choose whether the barrier applies to physical defence or magical defence.\nMAGIC SHOCK: One of your opponents loses their next action.\nMANIPULATION: You can activate any mechanical system at close range and within sight – locks, switches, levers, etc.\nMAGIC MISSILE: You inflict 1d6 + Wisdom damage points on a target within sight. You automatically hit without a saving throw.\nMINOR HEALING: You restore 1d6 + Wisdom hit points to an ally within sight.\n\n\n\nLevel 3\n\nMAGIC AUGMENTATION: You grant a +1 bonus to all actions of your allies for the duration of one combat.\nANTIDOTE: You cancel the effects of a pathogen, toxin, or nanodrug, including accelerators.\nINFLUENCE: A person of your choice finds you very likeable, even if they did not like you before. They will do you a service, but will not put their life in danger for you. The target can make a saving throw to cancel the spell’s effects.\nINVISIBILITY: You remain invisible (including on video monitors not protected against magic) as long as you perform no other action than moving.\nMAGIC MECHANICS: You temporarily enchant electronic equipment so that it works even against magic (for example, a pistol that can hit an Ætheric spirit or a motion detector that works on the Æther). Nevertheless, it simultaneously gains a magical defence and becomes sensitive to magical attacks.\n\n\n\nLevel 4\n\nÆTHERIC SEAL: You mark the lintel of a door or an opening with an invisible sign that prohibits Ætheric creatures from passing through for the entire current cycle.\nMAGIC EXPLOSION: You inflict 3d6 + Wisdom damage points on all people present within a radius equal to your Intelligence rank in meters, originating from the centre of the effect which must be in sight. The damage affects everyone, including yourself or your companions if you are in the area. Everyone can make a saving throw to halve the damage.\nSPIRIT FORM: You can take the form of an animal of your choice and benefit from its natural abilities.\nLEVITATION: You fly a few meters above the ground and move at a maximum speed close to running. If you were falling, you recover without damage a few decimetres from the ground.\nSURVIVAL: You resist the heat of a blaze, the cold of a blizzard, the pressure of a landslide, asphyxiation underwater or in foul air, etc.\n\n\n\nLevel 5\n\nCOUNTERMAGIC: You immediately cancel a spell or magical effect. You cannot send back an Ætheric spirit this way.\nINVOCATION: You summon a hermetic or orphic spirit (according to your tradition) that you can control for a time. Alchemists can never cast this spell.\nCOMBAT TELEPORTATION: You instantly teleport to a clear area that you can see live, including by electronic means.\nMANA STORM: You inflict 2d6 + Wisdom damage points on a number of enemies equal to 1d6 + Intelligence present on the battlefield – they can make a saving throw to halve the damage. Your companions are not affected.\nÆTHERIC TRAVEL: You leave your body, which falls inanimate, and you go wandering in the Æther. You perceive the real world within a 10-meter radius per rank of Wisdom, and no physical barrier can stop you from passing, unless it is a force field or an Ætheric seal. Nevertheless, while you float slightly, you cannot fly and you remain unconsciously bound to physically possible movements (you do not climb walls unless you use a ladder or proper handholds).\n\n\n\n\nSummoning\nWith the level 5 Convocation spell, magicians can summon particular etheric spirits - hermetic or orphic. When performing the short ritual to summon the spirit, you must decide its power - from 1 to 5, but it can never be greater than your Intelligence. The more powerful a spirit is, the greater its abilities and services, but the harder it is to control.\nA summoned spirit stays until its summoner sends it away, until it has completed all its services or until the next dawn or dusk - whichever comes first.\n\nControlling a spirit\nWhen the spirit appears, make an Intelligence (Knowing Spirits) roll against a difficulty equal to 5 + 5 per level of the spirit’s power - the difficulty of controlling a level 5 spirit is thus equal to 30! You can invest additional magic points, on a 1:1 basis, to increase the result of your roll.\nIf you succeed in controlling the spirit, it owes you a number of services equal to its level plus the result of the coloured die. If you fail to control the spirit, it may, at the discretion of the host:\n\nReturn immediately to the Æther.\nAttack you, because it did not like being disturbed.\nAgree to discuss and negotiate one or more services in exchange for something. Generally, the more powerful a spirit is, the more willing it is to negotiate. Payment can be magic points, physical offerings (with a variable cost in ¥) or one or more services in exchange.\n\n\n\nServices\nSpirits can perform several types of service. Each use of a service decreases the level of control - when all services have been used, the spirit disappears into the Æther.\n\nPERFORM A PHYSICAL ACTION: The spirit performs a physical action related to its nature. A fire spirit can burn something; a mountain spirit can carry a heavy load; a desert spirit can protect from the sun…\nACT AT A DISTANCE: The spirit agrees to perform a task entrusted to it by the hermetic or orphist and to leave for that purpose. It will do everything possible to accomplish its task before the end of its presence in the physical world, undoubtedly in a somewhat stubborn manner. Once this task is completed, the spirit disappears even if it had services left to perform.\nFIGHT: The spirit fights alongside the hermetic or orphist to the best of its abilities and until it is banished or the combat ends.\nCAST A SPELL: The spirit can authorise the character to cast a particular spell from the spirit’s list by normally spending the character’s magic points.\n\n\n\nMinor spirits\nHermetics and orphists can summon, without great constraint, those simple spirits that populate the edges of the Æther. A minor spirit is always of power 1. They can perform the following services:\n\nALARM: The spirit monitors or patrols a specific section of the Æther and warns a specific person in case of intrusion.\nESPIONNAGE: The spirit can follow and spy on someone from the Æther and return to report to the summoner. It is limited by Ætheric seals and other magical protections.\nHARASSMENT: In combat, a watchful spirit inflicts a malus of -1 to the physical and magical defences of a specific target. The target must be specified each round by the summoner.\nMESSAGE: The spirit carries a message to a known person from the summoner and brings back a response if necessary.\nTRACKING Ætheric: The spirit attempts to find an object, person or a place, in the Æther or on the physical world. It must be given a precise image or impression of what it is looking for.\n\n\n\nThe Hermetic Spirits\nOnly Hermeticists can summon these ætheric spirits. The wizard must be near a significant source of raw material for the summoning to work properly - if not, the host may deem the action impossible or increase the number of magic points needed to cast the spell.\n\nAir Spirit\nLIGHTNESS (1): You or an ally gain an additional 1d6 initiative points.\nSILENCE (2): You spread an aura of silence around you. You can act normally, speak inside the bubble and even hear what is being said outside, but no one will hear you outside the area.\nALTERED SENSES (3): You alter your senses to hear whispers from a great distance or to see silhouettes through a stone wall.\nBREATH (4): You enter into silent communication (questions and answers) with a number of people equal to your Charisma rank. They must be present when you cast the spell, but may separate afterwards.\nBOUCLIER OF WIND (5): You and all your allies gain a +2 bonus to physical defence. This spell does not stack with a Physical Ethereal Barrier.\n\n\nWater Spirit\nENCHANT (1): You enchant a melee weapon or a clip of projectiles by dipping them in water. The weapon becomes magical until the next short rest and allows you to hit creatures immune to physical attacks.\nDISGUISE (2): You quickly change your general appearance and silhouette, changing the shape or colour of your clothes, your stature, or your gait. Disguise does not deceive close examination, but also affects Augmented Reality.\nWALL (3): You raise a wall of water sufficient to obscure the doors to a room and its windows. Bullets are very strongly slowed down and deflected, sounds are distorted, infrared perceptions blurred…\nSLEEP (4): By placing your hands on a person, you put him/her into a deep sleep for several hours. This only works on physical creatures whose power is equal to or less than your Wisdom.\nTRICK (5): You automatically win at games of chance or you get a triple-6 on a roll of your choice - you do not gain a Heroic point for this one.\n\n\nEarth Spirit\nLAY ON HANDS (1): For each additional magic point you spend, you heal 2 + Wisdom life points by laying on your hands. You can spend multiple magic points on the same action.\nBLINDING (2): By placing your hand on a wall (wall, door, etc.), you grant it the ability to resist any projectile, including armour piercing or anti-tank. The ability ceases as soon as you remove your hand.\nFORTIFICATIONS (3): You build earthen embankments and ditches in a few minutes, providing good protection against projectiles and a tactically favourable position for some fighters (defence increased by the magician’s Intelligence for Wisdom fighters).\nSTONE SKIN (4): You can place, on touch, a number of stone skins equal to your Intelligence rank on one or more targets. Each stone skin negates a subsequent successful attack with a loud bang. You cannot reroll this spell as long as one or more stone skins remain active.\nPASS-WALL (5): You can physically pass through any wall made of stone, concrete, or brick, up to one metre thickness per rank of Wisdom. The passage is impossible if the wall is lined with metal or protected by an etheric seal.\n\n\nFire Spirit\nCOMFORT (1): You extend an aura of comfort around you that warms or cools a room, calms fears and anxieties, soothes nerves, or keeps you awake.\nKINETIC RECOVERY (2): Every attack on you - whether it hits or not - causes you to regain one point of magic.\nFLAMING WHIP (3): You create a flaming whip that can be used in close combat or at a distance, against physical or magical creatures. Choose the characteristic you use to wield it.\nFUGUE (4): You and all your companions immediately gain 1d6 initiative points.\nCONCEALMENT (5): You burn a combustible object of your choice, of a reasonable size (say, the equivalent of a large chest). At the moment of your choice, later on, light a fire and take the object out of the fire, perfectly intact (with a smell of smoke).\n\n\n\nThe Orphic Spirits\nOnly orphists can summon spirits of this type, which are deeply connected to the oneness of the world. You must be in a suitable environment to perform the summoning - if not, the host may deem the action impossible or increase the number of magic points needed to cast the spell. A suitable environment can be purely symbolic: the top of a tower for a mountain spirit, in a public park for a woodland spirit, in a UV cabin for a desert spirit…\n\nCity Spirit\nPASS FAST (1): You take the fastest streets and lanes, the least crowded or safest for you, to get where you need to go, speeding up your travel time considerably.\nRESCUE (2): If you are in a complicated situation, get out of it quickly - it’s easy to find a way out, even if it means breaking the law or taking physical risks.\nCAMOUFLAGE (3): You blend in with the background or the crowd, becoming unseen or unknown. No one pays any attention to you. For every extra point of magic you invest, you can extend the effects to another person.\nPASS THROUGH SHADOWS (4): You use shadows to slip from one person to another, to another place in sight.\nRUMOUR (5): Ask the host a question about the adventure. He will answer you simply and without lying.\n\n\nMountain Spirit\nBRUTE STRENGTH (1): You or an ally deal an additional 1d6 melee damage in close combat for the duration of a fight.\nABRI (2): If you are within four walls, no one can enter the room you are protecting, nor send missiles of any kind into it, unless you allow it. You must cast the spell a second time for the same limits to apply to the Æther.\nOBSERVATION (3): You split your vision by placing part of your perceptions up to several metres away, or by placing part of your perception up to several tens of metres above you to observe a scene from the sky.\nSTONE CROCS (4): All people present in an Intelligence radius around you at the time you cast the spell must give up moving or take 1d6 damage per manoeuvre. Vehicle tyres don’t like this at all either.\nCHAIN REACTION (5): You cause a chain reaction of coincidences and chance events that serve your immediate purposes. Describe how things happen - the leader will be happy to add to it.\n\n\nWood Spirit\nPASS WITHOUT TRACE (1): You leave no trace behind you - smells, DNA, fingerprints, RFID identification, etc. The spell only works for a limited geographical area: a room, a piece of pavement, etc. You can cast it before or after acting on it, depending on your needs. You must cast it a second time to protect yourself from detection.\nSPINES (2): Opponents engaged in hand-to-hand combat with you take 1d6 damage (minus their protection value) at the start of their turn.\nPOTION (3): You can prepare a magic potion with the effect of your choice. The operation takes a day’s work and a night’s rest; on the other hand, it is likely that you will have to spend ¥1 or more on ingredients. The potion can be used until the end of the cycle.\nSPEAK WITH ANIMALS (4): You speak to vertebrate creatures and make yourself understood by them. They can respond to the extent of their intelligence and abilities.\nANIMATE PLANTS (5): You control the natural movement of plants to move brambles and bushes, make grasses cling to boots, and have nettles and sumac whip exposed skin. Your enemies suffer in many ways - loss of time and manoeuvres, damage, etc. Choose a different effect and target each turn.\n\n\nSpirit of the Rivers and Seas\nIMMERSION (1): When you immerse yourself in a body of water, you breathe perfectly and swim like a fish. Alternatively, you can even metamorphose into a fish.\nSMOKE (2): You deposit a certain undetectable smell on an object or person. You can follow this smell until the next dawn or dusk, even through a crowd or a complicated environment.\nTRANSPORT (3): You use rivers to travel from one point in their course to another, upstream or downstream. The journey is not instantaneous, but it is extremely fast.\nMAJOR CARE (4): By immersing yourself for several hours in a natural body of water, you heal a wound.\nPUPPET (5): You take possession of the water that makes up an individual and you make them perform the actions of your choice for a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence. For each action that is contrary to their interests, the subject may make a saving throw to resist.\n\n\nDesert Spirit\nPURIFY (1): You purify a supply of food or water, removing toxins and dangerous pathogens.\nFARSIGHT (2): You expand your vision at will, as if you were using a pair of binoculars at high magnification or a microscope.\nMOUNT (3): You call to you a spirit that takes the form of a horse and can carry you away at the speed of a motor vehicle.\nDUST (4): Your body (and everything you wear) becomes a cloud of intangible dust. You can no longer interact with the physical world and vice versa. You can slip into narrow gaps.\nTORNADO (5): You deal 1d6 damage to all enemies in the area. In addition, they are pushed back several metres and fall to the ground.\n\n\n\n\nGuide\nThe orphist who awakens to magic understands that he is one with the universe and, at the heart of this universe, he finds a kindred spirit who will guide him and help him on the long initiatory path that will lead him to absolute unification, granting him special abilities and a disadvantage specific to his nature. You can ignore the effects of a disadvantage by spending a point of luck. If you are playing an orphist, choose a guide from the following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuide\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\n\n\n\n\nANANKÉ\nYou have a +4 bonus to resist poisons and diseases.

    "text": "Cyberpsychosis\n\n\n\nThe human mind is not hard-wired to handle major bodily changes - you quickly get used to your physical body.

And then anything can happen: blackouts, memory loss, ghost hacking, psychotic episodes, akashic hallucinations, irrepressible violent outbursts, amok, catatonia, etc. It’s up to you if you want to end up like one of those shaking cyborgs, reduced to the state of trunk-men and stripped, for reasons of public safety, of all their cybernetics.\n\n\n\nNeuronic\nNeural Plug: You can operate any equipment with a neural plug to improve its efficiency.

    "text": "Weapons\n\nYou and I both know that violence is like a drug. You come back for a shot and you regret it immediately. But you can’t help it, can you?\n—Maxime Chattam, The Primal Conjuration\n\nYou can modify your weapons and armour to give them special abilities. In addition, there are several types of projectiles for weapons - for the record, the vast majority of weapons now use caseless ammunition and electric firing systems that allow for a higher rate of fire.\n\nFirearms\nEach option costs ¥4. Options marked with an * can be taken more than once.\n\nTARGET LOCK: The character must aim for a full turn, without being hindered or having to move. The weapon records up to three targets in its aiming memory. On the following turn, the character can make up to three successive shots.\nVERSATILE CHAMBERING: The weapon accepts special ammunition of all types.\nDISCREET: The weapon is particularly discreet and reduces its discretion category by one level.\nIFF: If the character’s allies have an IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) interface on their protection, it is impossible to target them by mistake. The weapon automatically blocks the shot, even during a burst fire.\nIMPACT *: You have a +1 bonus to damage (maximum +3).\nINTERFACED: Neuronic The weapon is interfaced with the character’s neural wiring. Attack +2.\nLONG RANGE: You have no attack penalty at long distance.\nMENACING: You have a +2 bonus to intimidation against people who only understand force.\nVOCAL MULTI-LOADER: [Versatile Chambering] This option allows firing different ammunition types within the same turn. Vocal sensitivity is adjustable for infiltration missions and only reacts to your voice signature.\nPRECISION: You have a +2 bonus to attack.\nSECURED: Only people whose genetic code is registered and encoded in the grip can activate the weapon.\nSILENCED: Firing this weapon does not get you spotted when no one is too close to the detonation or, conversely, when there is a lot of noise around.\nBURST FIRE: You can engage multiple opponents within range in the same action. The defense of the strongest target is increased by +1 per additional target. All hit targets suffer the same damage.\nRAPID FIRE: [Interfaced] You can make an additional shot in the turn by spending one connection point.\nLASER SIGHT: The weapon has a laser sight. Precision +1. This option is useless if the weapon is interfaced.\n\n\n\nAmmunition\nSpecial ammunition costs connection points which you spend for each combat. However, once the cost is paid, you can use the ammunition for the duration of the fight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMMUNITION\nCOST\nEFFECTS\n\n\n\n\nSELF-GUIDED\n2\nThese are actually self-propelled micro-missiles that the weapon guides to the target or that are locked on by geolocation (via the matrix), infrared signal, or laser pointing by an ally in position. Accuracy +2 or +0 against targets hidden behind obstacles.\n\n\nSHOCK\n1\nThis non-lethal ammunition cannot kill its target but only render it powerless.\n\n\nEMP\n7\nElectromagnetic discharges are waves that disrupt or destroy electronic equipment. Security services are often armed with EMP pistols to stop coders, cyborgs, and terrorists of all kinds. EMP ammunition is quite terrifying and therefore highly controlled. It is quite difficult to obtain because it can very easily bring very expensive equipment to its knees. Apply the EMP effects based on the damage die as explained below.\n\n\nEXPANDING\n1\nExpanding ammunition is particularly useful against unprotected targets (damage +2) and objects.\n\n\nDARTS\n3\nDarts can contain doses of toxins that can cause specific effects. Apply the effects of the darts based on the damage die as explained below.\n\n\nARMOR-PIERCING\n2\nThis ammunition ignores the defense bonuses from protections, but inflicts -3 damage.\n\n\n\nEMP ammunition or darts do not deal damage to hit points. You simply read the result of the damage die, with any bonuses, and apply the effects shown in the table opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAMAGE\nEMP\nDART (TRANQUILIZER)\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe discharge causes no real damage to the equipment, apart from a very temporary minor overheating.\nThe dart catches on clothing and does nothing.\n\n\n2 - 3\nThe equipment stops working for one turn. If the equipment is vital, the character falls to the ground and cannot act.\nThe target is stunned. They have a -2 penalty on all their actions until they can rest.\n\n\n4\nThe equipment stops working for the rest of the scene or until it can be restarted.\nThe target is nauseous. They only roll two dice for all their actions until they can rest.\n\n\n5\nThe equipment stops working for the rest of the cycle and it will cost at least 4 ¥ to repair everything.\nSame.\n\n\n6 or more\nThe equipment is permanently destroyed and stops functioning. The destruction of vital equipment (cybernetic enhancements, for example) can lead to death. In any case, everything must be replaced at full price.\nThe target falls unconscious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaseless ammunition\n\n\n\nThe principle of caseless ammunition is to eliminate the casing that contains the primer, the explosive, and the bullet. These three elements are now held together by a binding agent. Most caseless ammunition, intended for electric weapons, has even replaced the primer and the explosive with a chemical propellant agent.\nWhile weapons with traditional chambered ammunition still exist, most armies, security services, and corporate forces now use caseless ammunition. The logistics, shape, and use of caseless weapons have considerably changed the habits of shooters.\nAfter the first unsuccessful tests at the end of the 20th century by the firm H&K in Germany, several companies took an interest in caseless ammunition until they obtained a stable formula that largely eliminated the flaws of the early models. It is the descendants of this ammunition that you now use in nanoChrome.\nCaseless ammunition has multiple advantages—and most of the disadvantages have been corrected. With the casing gone, there is no longer a need to eject it. Weapons therefore only have five mechanical operations to perform to load and fire, instead of seven for classic weapons. The rate of fire has thus been able to increase significantly. Furthermore, the weapons can be sealed against humidity, mold, and dust. Finally, they are now available for left-handed and right-handed users without additional modifications—which used to increase production and design costs. Caseless ammunition is particularly valued for vehicle-mounted weapons.\nLighter and cheaper to manufacture, caseless ammunition has undeniable advantages for armed forces: more can be carried for the same weight, allowing for longer missions and less substantial supply lines. Moreover, their rectangular shape (which can be surprising) allows them to be stored more efficiently, to avoid friction problems in magazines, and to obtain more powerful propellant charges in more limited sizes.\nThe problems of recoil (compression gases were poorly eliminated), heat (the casings carried away part of the heat upon their ejection), and durability (the first ammunition models handled the stress of combat and extreme conditions poorly) have been successfully resolved over the last thirty years. To claim that a caseless weapon is less reliable than a classic weapon is today the same kind of myth as the one that made people prefer revolvers over pistols at the end of the 20th century.\nNevertheless, two different designs compete: on one hand, weapons that rely on a mechanical system with ammunition comprising a primer and an explosive; on the other hand, weapons that rely on an electrical system with chemical ammunition.\nMany believe the former are still the most reliable. Mechanical systems no longer jam since the casings were eliminated from the equation. They are, however, a little heavier and slower than their electrical competitors.\nThe latter have a bad reputation due to several incidents of insufficient charge that have been costly for unprepared individuals. Nevertheless, they are lighter and faster and often have much more interesting looks, with comprehensive options for aiming and ballistic tracking.\nAnd looks count, don’t they?\n\n\n\n\nMelee\nEach option costs ¥4. Options marked with * can be taken more than once.\n\nELECTRIC SHOCK *: Once per combat, when you make a melee attack, add 1d6 to the damage you inflict.\nVIBROBLADE: The blade can generate an ultrasonic vibration that destroys physical structures or destabilises them.\nDISCREET: The weapon is particularly discreet and reduces its discretion category by one level.\nIMPACT *: You have a +2 bonus to damage (maximum +6).\nINTERFACED: Neuronic The weapon is interfaced with the character’s neural wiring. Attack +2.\nSHAPE MEMORY: The nanomachines that constitute the blade retract into a reservoir located in the hilt, for reduced encumbrance. The nano-blade has no sheath and is easily stored in a coat or bag. However, it takes a full turn for the blade to deploy completely.\nMENACING: You have a +2 bonus to intimidation against people who only understand force.\nPRECISION: You have a +2 bonus to attack.\nPRESTIGIOUS: You have a +2 bonus for social relations with people who admire style – provided the weapon is visible.\nSECURED: Only people whose genetic code is registered and encoded in the grip can activate the weapon.",

    "text": "Accelerators\n\n“Drug abuse is not a disease; it is a decision, just like driving down the street in front of a speeding car. It is not called a disease, but an error in judgment.”\n—Philip K. Dick, Dead Substance\n\nAccelerators are combat nanodrugs that have fallen into the public domain by force of circumstance. They are not particularly recreational drugs, although they can sometimes get you high, but tools that techmercs use and abuse. Fortunately, the problems of addiction are mainly psychological.\nYou cannot combine the effects of two different accelerators at the same time.\nA character can consume accelerators at will without spending ¥, but suffers the negative side effects. If he chooses to spend ¥1 to buy a dose of accelerator, he can ignore the side effects - he knows the right addresses and has access to good stuff.\nBeware: some corporations prohibit the use of drugs by their employees and operate frequent controls. Also, while you can walk around with a dose or two on you, the police take a very dim view of suitcases full of drugs…\nCAROLINE SAYS: Drugs kill all the emotions you might feel. You become cold as death, insensitive to love, hate, anger, joy or sadness. You gain a +2 bonus to all rolls requiring concentration and detachment, including holding a target in its scope. On the other hand, you have an equivalent penalty on all rolls involving social interaction.\nCHELSEA GIRL: You begin to see life in a slightly different light. Each of your eyes adapts to a different vision: one sees virtual reality, the other unvarnished reality. You mix the two perceptions for three hours and fifteen minutes. Afterwards, you may note an injury to yourself - the human mind is not designed to withstand such an ordeal.\nDIRTY BOULEVARD: This is pure high. You turn your head upside down and forget your worries and the darkness of the world. You with a general malus of -4 to all actions throughout the day and night - you stammer and drool like an incomprehensible acid-addled pithecanthrope. During the next day, once you’ve come to your senses, clear-headed and cleansed, you benefit from a special acuity: whenever you have to roll dice, place one of them (not the damage die) on the side of your choice and roll the others. Each time you use this ability, roll 1d6: on 6+, the accelerator stops working.\nFEMME FATALE: You become devilishly seductive and exude powerful sexual nanormones. You have a +4 bonus to all social relationships for several hours. But you begin to have trouble managing your own desires, and when the accelerator stops working, you begin to hate yourself and have a -1 Charisma penalty for the rest of the cycle.\nGOOD FORTUNE: You float on your own cloud and escape into your own world. Nothing can go wrong. You don’t care about anything, including difficulties. There is nothing you cannot achieve. You have a +1 bonus to all your actions until the end of the cycle, but you cannot gain any experience bonus by spending ¥.\nHALLOWEEN PARADE: You begin to glow, literally, with good health - your skin seems to glow slightly and draws admiring glances. Your beauty is heightened. No matter how much accreditation is required for a party or social event, you are let in with no problem. A little buoyant, a little giddy with intoxication and bubbly, you nevertheless have a -2 malus to all physical actions or combat for the rest of the night.\nLADY DAY: Your mind comes to grips with the deeper nature of the matrix. You begin to sense and see the spirits of the matrix, the legendary AIs that live in the interstices of virtual reality. You can ask them for a major service related to the matrix. Once the spirits are gone, you are completely cut off from the matrix for 1d6 days, too busy to get out of the self-destructive spiral that makes you hate your body and everything that makes you a mere mortal.\nMIRROR: You become a mirror of your contemporaries and your general empathy increases considerably. You instinctively understand their desires and motivations. While you are under the effect of the accelerator, you are unable to use the matrix.\nPERFECT DAY: This recreational drug clears your mind of the dark clouds that accumulate in it. You feel like you’re drinking sangria at the zoo, toes out, for hours and hours. In reality, the feel-good flash lasts only a few seconds and can be enough to shake you up. When you’re down to 0 hit points, you can use this accelerator to get back up to 5 hit points immediately.\nRUN RUN RUN: Using this accelerator as a catalyst, you can take two different accelerators and mix up their effects (and their descent). If you don’t pay for the Run Run Run, you are forced to suffer the downslides of the other accelerators, even if you have paid for them.\nSAD SONG: You are in the midst of a spleen and are contemplating your life in a state of advanced dissociation, trying to take stock. You can’t socialise with anyone for a whole day because you are so deep in the dark. The next day you have a +4 bonus to all your negotiation and diplomacy rolls.\nSATELLITE OF LOVE: This nanodrug allows you to share a special affinity with the matrix. You leave your body (be careful where you leave it) and walk around as if you were an Akashic spirit. You gain 1d6+3 points of connection and can run programs directly as a fully functioning nexus. The walk lasts one hour per Intelligence point. You are then cut off from the matrix for twenty-four hours.\nSISTER RAY: This experimental nanodrug is just starting to hit the streets. It explodes your psyche into eight different personalities (calm, angry, cold, empath, autistic, victim, killer, lover). You can switch from one to the other according to your needs. Each personality functions as a skill. It’s a bit of a rough ride when you put the pieces back together: you have a -4 penalty to all your social actions for the rest of the cycle.\nSWEET JANE: Tell the host when you ingest this drug. At any time up to the end of the cycle, you can declare that everything that happened in the interim was a dream, a sketch of a possible future, a sort of psychometric vision of your desires. Replay all the scenes. Everything.\nVENUS IN FUR: Pain becomes distant, vaguely exotic information. Physical torture does not work on you. Until the end of the cycle, ignore the effects of wound malus (though you continue to register it normally). At the end of the cycle, you lose one Constitution rank or one Wisdom rank for a full cycle. You have a slight tendency to be hypersensitive and cry over nothing.\nVICIOUS: This accelerator exacerbates your violent impulses - you turn into a vicious, instinctive beast, reacting to the slightest stimulus and provocation. You have a +2 bonus to attack and melee damage, but the host can force you to react physically to frustration and anger.\nWHITE HEAT: The nanophets found on the street are slightly less powerful than their military counterparts, but they also drain a lot less. You don’t need to sleep for a full night. You do get a bit paranoid though, and you experience some lapses in your usual social relationships.\nWHITE LIGHT: You inject yourself with combat nanophets. You can stop sleeping for the rest of the cycle if you wish. However, you definitely lose one Constitution rank at the end of it.",
