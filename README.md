# Cyberpunk

Twenty minutes in the future.\
Orbital corpos.\
Indecent fortunes\
and endemic poverty.\
Freewheeling technology.\
Information warfare.\
Akashic matrix.\
Techmercs looking for juicy contracts.\
Temptations and desires.\
You.\
Up to your neck.

In memory of Lou Reed,\
the cyberpunker before cyberpunk.

> I remain convinced that a journalist is not an altar boy and that his role does not consist in preceding processions, with his hand dipped in a basket of rose petals. Our job is not to please, nor to do harm, it is to take the pen to the wound.
