<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Because in our system, it is simply unthinkable! All we know is the accumulation of capital. You know how it works: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. There is no word or expression in the language to describe the opposite process. Proof, if any were needed, of the emptiness of our imagination. Once or twice I have come across the expression ‘De-accumulation of capital’, but applied to some kind of accident or mistake, and that is not what I have in mind. I’m talking about a deliberate, positive action. I’ve tried to call it capital dispersion - scattering of capital… You see the problem. It sounds wrong, even in the language. Redistribution of profits… you see how all the terms at our disposal for this describe actions which come after the accumulation of capital. Dispersing capital at the precise moment of its creation - it sounds almost contradictory, actually, and in a way it is; in our system there is no word or theory to explain the dispersal of capital without obligation of some kind. Pre-emption of dividends? Usufruct? I leave it to the bloggers to look up, as an exercise, the most appropriate term.”</p>

<p>The human mind is not hard-wired to handle major bodily changes - you quickly get used to your physical body. When you abuse cybernetics, beyond the natural limit set by your Constitution rank, you run the risk of permanently blowing a fuse. At any moment, the game leader can take control of your character - a bit like a galley, but worse (and without the XP). And then anything can happen: blackouts, memory loss, ghost hacking, psychotic episodes, akashic hallucinations, irrepressible violent outbursts, amok, catatonia, etc. It’s up to you if you want to end up like one of those shaking cyborgs, reduced to the state of trunk-men and stripped, for reasons of public safety, of all their cybernetics.</p>

Caseless ammunition
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The principle of caseless ammunition is to eliminate the casing that contains the primer, the explosive, and the bullet. These three elements are now held together by a binding agent. Most caseless ammunition, intended for electric weapons, has even replaced the primer and the explosive with a chemical propellant agent.</p>
<p>While weapons with traditional chambered ammunition still exist, most armies, security services, and corporate forces now use caseless ammunition. The logistics, shape, and use of caseless weapons have considerably changed the habits of shooters.</p>
<p>After the first unsuccessful tests at the end of the 20th century by the firm H&amp;K in Germany, several companies took an interest in caseless ammunition until they obtained a stable formula that largely eliminated the flaws of the early models. It is the descendants of this ammunition that you now use in nanoChrome.</p>
<p>Caseless ammunition has multiple advantages—and most of the disadvantages have been corrected. With the casing gone, there is no longer a need to eject it. Weapons therefore only have five mechanical operations to perform to load and fire, instead of seven for classic weapons. The rate of fire has thus been able to increase significantly. Furthermore, the weapons can be sealed against humidity, mold, and dust. Finally, they are now available for left-handed and right-handed users without additional modifications—which used to increase production and design costs. Caseless ammunition is particularly valued for vehicle-mounted weapons.</p>
<p>Lighter and cheaper to manufacture, caseless ammunition has undeniable advantages for armed forces: more can be carried for the same weight, allowing for longer missions and less substantial supply lines. Moreover, their rectangular shape (which can be surprising) allows them to be stored more efficiently, to avoid friction problems in magazines, and to obtain more powerful propellant charges in more limited sizes.</p>
<p>The problems of recoil (compression gases were poorly eliminated), heat (the casings carried away part of the heat upon their ejection), and durability (the first ammunition models handled the stress of combat and extreme conditions poorly) have been successfully resolved over the last thirty years. To claim that a caseless weapon is less reliable than a classic weapon is today the same kind of myth as the one that made people prefer revolvers over pistols at the end of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, two different designs compete: on one hand, weapons that rely on a mechanical system with ammunition comprising a primer and an explosive; on the other hand, weapons that rely on an electrical system with chemical ammunition.</p>
<p>Many believe the former are still the most reliable. Mechanical systems no longer jam since the casings were eliminated from the equation. They are, however, a little heavier and slower than their electrical competitors.</p>
<p>The latter have a bad reputation due to several incidents of insufficient charge that have been costly for unprepared individuals. Nevertheless, they are lighter and faster and often have much more interesting looks, with comprehensive options for aiming and ballistic tracking.</p>
<p>And looks count, don’t they?</p>

<section id="cpa-personal-power-suit" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cpa-personal-power-suit">CPA (PERSONAL POWER SUIT)</h3>
<p>CPAs are powered armour, mechas about three metres high, controlled by a pilot in an inner cockpit and possibly interfaced to the aircraft. Each CPA also has an autonomous nexus that assists and advises the pilot in his tasks, while making all the necessary micro-adjustments in real time - these assistants often end up with a unique name and personality, which makes them stand out to their owners.</p>
<p>You can act inside a CPA in the same way as if you were on foot - including fighting, running, jumping, etc. Of course, the size and mass of the craft gives you some advantages or disadvantages depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>A basic APC grants a +2 bonus to defence, grants a +5 bonus to damage from all attacks and can take three wounds.</p>
<p>Unarmed and unarmoured APCs are considered civilian or work vehicles and are therefore perfectly legal. Combat APCs are reserved for security services.</p>
<p>Each option costs ¥4. Options marked with an * can be taken more than once.</p>
<ul>
<li>ACCELERATION *: The CPA can move at higher speeds. Factory-standard, a CPA is very slow. Each rank of acceleration allows it to change category (slow, medium, fast, ultra-fast).</li>
<li>ANTI-SHOCK: The CPA ignores the effects of injuries. If it is “killed,” the CPA is simply immobilized for the rest of the combat and can be repaired. Without this option, the CPA is destroyed and good for scrap.</li>
<li>ARMAMENT: The CPA has a weapon. Refer to the weapon lists (melee and ranged) to choose specific options.</li>
<li>PILOTING ASSISTANCE *: You have a +2 bonus for all movements with a CPA.</li>
<li>ARMOR PLATING *: The factory-standard CPA has no armour plating. Each option allows gaining an armour rank (light, medium, heavy) – be aware, medium and heavy armour plating are generally subject to authorisation and considered military equipment (see page 171).</li>
<li>EMP PROTECTION *: Each protection option allows you to cancel one EMP effect per cycle.</li>
<li>JUMPS: The CPA has thrusters allowing it to make jumps of several tens of meters.</li>
<li>ENVIRONMENTAL SEALS *: The cockpit protects the pilot against extreme external conditions (vacuum, cold, heat, toxins, radiation, etc) for 12 hours. You can take this option multiple times to increase the duration by 6 hours.</li>
<li>SENSORS: Each sensor point allows acquiring a specific system: thermographic vision, X-ray vision, night vision, motion detector, range increase, etc) Refer to the panoptic list (cybernetics) to choose specific options.</li>
<li>SOLIDITY *: The CPA can withstand an additional injury.</li>
<li>SUPERIOR POWER: The CPA gives a +4 bonus to all raw power actions. It can lift considerable masses.</li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Drug abuse is not a disease; it is a decision, just like driving down the street in front of a speeding car. It is not called a disease, but an error in judgment.”</p>
<p>—Philip K. Dick, Dead Substance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accelerators are combat nanodrugs that have fallen into the public domain by force of circumstance. They are not particularly recreational drugs, although they can sometimes get you high, but tools that techmercs use and abuse. Fortunately, the problems of addiction are mainly psychological.</p>
<p>You cannot combine the effects of two different accelerators at the same time.</p>
<p>A character can consume accelerators at will without spending ¥, but suffers the negative side effects. If he chooses to spend ¥1 to buy a dose of accelerator, he can ignore the side effects - he knows the right addresses and has access to good stuff.</p>
<p>Beware: some corporations prohibit the use of drugs by their employees and operate frequent controls. Also, while you can walk around with a dose or two on you, the police take a very dim view of suitcases full of drugs…</p>
<p>CAROLINE SAYS: Drugs kill all the emotions you might feel. You become cold as death, insensitive to love, hate, anger, joy or sadness. You gain a +2 bonus to all rolls requiring concentration and detachment, including holding a target in its scope. On the other hand, you have an equivalent penalty on all rolls involving social interaction.</p>
<p>CHELSEA GIRL: You begin to see life in a slightly different light. Each of your eyes adapts to a different vision: one sees virtual reality, the other unvarnished reality. You mix the two perceptions for three hours and fifteen minutes. Afterwards, you may note an injury to yourself - the human mind is not designed to withstand such an ordeal.</p>
<p>DIRTY BOULEVARD: This is pure high. You turn your head upside down and forget your worries and the darkness of the world. You with a general malus of -4 to all actions throughout the day and night - you stammer and drool like an incomprehensible acid-addled pithecanthrope. During the next day, once you’ve come to your senses, clear-headed and cleansed, you benefit from a special acuity: whenever you have to roll dice, place one of them (not the damage die) on the side of your choice and roll the others. Each time you use this ability, roll 1d6: on 6+, the accelerator stops working.</p>
<p>FEMME FATALE: You become devilishly seductive and exude powerful sexual nanormones. You have a +4 bonus to all social relationships for several hours. But you begin to have trouble managing your own desires, and when the accelerator stops working, you begin to hate yourself and have a -1 Charisma penalty for the rest of the cycle.</p>
<p>GOOD FORTUNE: You float on your own cloud and escape into your own world. Nothing can go wrong. You don’t care about anything, including difficulties. There is nothing you cannot achieve. You have a +1 bonus to all your actions until the end of the cycle, but you cannot gain any experience bonus by spending ¥.</p>
<p>HALLOWEEN PARADE: You begin to glow, literally, with good health - your skin seems to glow slightly and draws admiring glances. Your beauty is heightened. No matter how much accreditation is required for a party or social event, you are let in with no problem. A little buoyant, a little giddy with intoxication and bubbly, you nevertheless have a -2 malus to all physical actions or combat for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>LADY DAY: Your mind comes to grips with the deeper nature of the matrix. You begin to sense and see the spirits of the matrix, the legendary AIs that live in the interstices of virtual reality. You can ask them for a major service related to the matrix. Once the spirits are gone, you are completely cut off from the matrix for 1d6 days, too busy to get out of the self-destructive spiral that makes you hate your body and everything that makes you a mere mortal.</p>
<p>MIRROR: You become a mirror of your contemporaries and your general empathy increases considerably. You instinctively understand their desires and motivations. While you are under the effect of the accelerator, you are unable to use the matrix.</p>
<p>PERFECT DAY: This recreational drug clears your mind of the dark clouds that accumulate in it. You feel like you’re drinking sangria at the zoo, toes out, for hours and hours. In reality, the feel-good flash lasts only a few seconds and can be enough to shake you up. When you’re down to 0 hit points, you can use this accelerator to get back up to 5 hit points immediately.</p>
<p>RUN RUN RUN: Using this accelerator as a catalyst, you can take two different accelerators and mix up their effects (and their descent). If you don’t pay for the Run Run Run, you are forced to suffer the downslides of the other accelerators, even if you have paid for them.</p>
<p>SAD SONG: You are in the midst of a spleen and are contemplating your life in a state of advanced dissociation, trying to take stock. You can’t socialise with anyone for a whole day because you are so deep in the dark. The next day you have a +4 bonus to all your negotiation and diplomacy rolls.</p>
<p>SATELLITE OF LOVE: This nanodrug allows you to share a special affinity with the matrix. You leave your body (be careful where you leave it) and walk around as if you were an Akashic spirit. You gain 1d6+3 points of connection and can run programs directly as a fully functioning nexus. The walk lasts one hour per Intelligence point. You are then cut off from the matrix for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>SISTER RAY: This experimental nanodrug is just starting to hit the streets. It explodes your psyche into eight different personalities (calm, angry, cold, empath, autistic, victim, killer, lover). You can switch from one to the other according to your needs. Each personality functions as a skill. It’s a bit of a rough ride when you put the pieces back together: you have a -4 penalty to all your social actions for the rest of the cycle.</p>
<p>SWEET JANE: Tell the host when you ingest this drug. At any time up to the end of the cycle, you can declare that everything that happened in the interim was a dream, a sketch of a possible future, a sort of psychometric vision of your desires. Replay all the scenes. Everything.</p>
<p>VENUS IN FUR: Pain becomes distant, vaguely exotic information. Physical torture does not work on you. Until the end of the cycle, ignore the effects of wound malus (though you continue to register it normally). At the end of the cycle, you lose one Constitution rank or one Wisdom rank for a full cycle. You have a slight tendency to be hypersensitive and cry over nothing.</p>
<p>VICIOUS: This accelerator exacerbates your violent impulses - you turn into a vicious, instinctive beast, reacting to the slightest stimulus and provocation. You have a +2 bonus to attack and melee damage, but the host can force you to react physically to frustration and anger.</p>
<p>WHITE HEAT: The nanophets found on the street are slightly less powerful than their military counterparts, but they also drain a lot less. You don’t need to sleep for a full night. You do get a bit paranoid though, and you experience some lapses in your usual social relationships.</p>
<p>WHITE LIGHT: You inject yourself with combat nanophets. You can stop sleeping for the rest of the cycle if you wish. However, you definitely lose one Constitution rank at the end of it.</p>
